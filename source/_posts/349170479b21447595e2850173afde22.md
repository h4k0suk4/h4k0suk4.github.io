# Scenario

Check out our new cloud service, Authentication Anywhere -- log in from anywhere you would like! Users can enter their username and password, for a totally secure login process! You definitely wouldn't be able to find any secrets that other people have in their profile, right?

**Access this challenge** by deploying both the vulnerable machine by pressing the green "`Start Machine`" button located within this task, and the TryHackMe AttackBox by pressing the  "`Start AttackBox`" button located at the top-right of the page.

Navigate to the following URL using the AttackBox: `http://MACHINE_IP`

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.23.253 - neighbour.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.23.253 neighbour.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.23.253
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] neighbour.thm

Here we have a login portal. We can use the guest account by checking the source code for the credentials. Pressing `CTRL + U` or right-clicking on the page and then selecting "View page source" will open the source code window:

After logging in, we are redirected to the user profile page. The URL of this page also has the parameter "`user`" which contains the value "`guest`":

`http://neighbour.thm/profile.php?user=guest`

If we check the source code for this page, we'll find another hint in the comments:

We can test to see if this parameter is being used to display the username on the page by editing the URL:

`http://neighbour.thm/profile.php?user=test`

Now, let's see what would happen if we changed it from `test` to `admin`:

`http://neighbour.thm/profile.php?user=admin`
