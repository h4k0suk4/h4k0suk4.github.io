# Scenario

Oh no, not again! One of our developers accidentally committed some sensitive code to our GitHub repository. Well, at least, that is what they told us... the problem is, we don't remember what or where! Can you track down what we accidentally committed?

Access this challenge by deploying the machine attached to this task by pressing the green "`Start Machine`" button. You will need to use the in-browser view to complete this room. Don't see anything? Press the `"Show Split Screen`" button at the top of the page.

The files you need are located in `/home/ubuntu/commited` on the VM attached to this task.

# Analysis

We start off with a ZIP archive where we can extract and do a quick [grep](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep) search for the string "`flag{`" with the options `-i` for ignore filename case sensitivity, and `-r` for searching recursivly:

```sh
unzip
grep -ir "flag{*" . 2>/dev/null
```

Not what we're looking for:

Let's turn to [Git](https://git-scm.com/). First make sure you are in the directory we just extracted, `/home/ubuntu/commited/commited` (there is a typo in the directory name). We can list the branches using the command `git branch`, where we will find two branches: `main` and `dbint`:

```sh
git branch
```

The `main` branch doesn't have anything interesting either, so let's move on to `dbint`. We can select it by using the `git switch` command:

```sh
git switch dbint
```

Using the `git log` command, we can print a list of the commit history log. Scrolling through the output, we will find a commit with the comment: "Oops":

```sh
git log
```

Press the Up or Down arrow keys to scroll through or the `Q` key to quit.

To view this commit, we can use the `git show` command and find the flag in the `password` field:

```sh
git show c56c470a2a9dfb5cfbd54cd614a9fdb1644412b5
```
