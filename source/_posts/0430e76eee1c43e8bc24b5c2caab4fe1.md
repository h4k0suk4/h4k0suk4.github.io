# Scenario

Want to be a part of the elite club of CyberHeroes? Prove your merit by finding a way to log in!

Access this challenge by deploying both the vulnerable machine by pressing the green "`Start Machine`" button located within this task, and the TryHackMe AttackBox by pressing the  "`Start AttackBox`" button located at the top-right of the page.

Navigate to the following URL using the AttackBox: `http://MACHINE_IP`

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.0.129 - cyber.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.0.129 cyber.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.0.129
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] cyber.thm/login.html

Our task is to bypass this login page:

We can check the source code for this page by pressing `CTRL + U` or right-clicking on the page, then select "View page source". Starting from line 123, we will find that the authentication is being done client-side. On line 128, we will find the username in plaintext and the password in reverse:

After logging in with these credentials, we will find the flag:
