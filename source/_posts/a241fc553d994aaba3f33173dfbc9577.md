# Scenario

Oooh, turns out, this `MACHINE_IP` machine is also a DNS server! If we could `dig` into it, I am sure we could find some interesting records! But... it seems weird, this only responds to a special type of request for a `givemetheflag.com` domain?

**Access this challenge** by deploying both the vulnerable machine by pressing the green "`Start Machine`" button located within this task, and the TryHackMe AttackBox by pressing the  "`Start AttackBox`" button located at the top-right of the page.

Use some common DNS enumeration tools installed on the AttackBox to get the DNS server on `MACHINE_IP` to respond with the flag.

# Enumeration

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.162.65 givemetheflag.com" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.162.65
```

Now, we are able to query the DNS server using the [dig](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig) tool. We will use the `-t MX` option to grab the [Mail Exchange record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record) where we will find the flag.

```sh
dig @$RHOSTS givemetheflag.com -t MX
```

- `@RHOSTS`: This specifies the DNS server to query.
- `givemetheflag.com`: This is the domain name for which you want to look up DNS records.
- `-t MX`: This option specifies the type of DNS record you want to retrieve, in this case, MX records. MX (Mail Exchange) records are used for email routing, indicating which mail servers can receive email on behalf of the domain.
