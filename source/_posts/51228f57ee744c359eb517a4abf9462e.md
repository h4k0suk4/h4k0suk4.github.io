# Scenario

Sometimes all you know against a target is an IP address. Can you complete the challenge and conduct an in-depth probe on the target?

## Q & A

> Before starting enumeration, I like to create the `RHOSTS` environment variable with the target IP address so it's easier to plug into various commands. Use the `export` command to create it, for example `export RHOSTS=<TARGET_IP>`

1. What is the version of the Apache server?
   *2.4.41*

> Run an Nmap scan. I used this command: `sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt`.
>
> - `-v` ... For verbosity
> - `-Pn` ... Skips the ping test - it helps discover hosts that don't respont to pings
> - `-sS` ... TCP SYN Stealth scan for faster scanning and creates less noise
> - `-p-` .... Scans all ports
> - `-A` ... Enables OS and version detection, amongst other things
> - `--min-rate` ... Minimum rate to send packets
> - `-T4` ... Aggressive speed scan (from a range of 1-5)
> - `-oN` ... Save output to text file
>   After a couple of minutes, the scan will be completed and we can check the results to find multiple Apache installations of the same version:

2. What is the port number of the FTP service?
   *1338*

> Check the Nmap scan in the terminal or use the command: `cat nmap.txt` to print the completed scan results from question 1 and look for `ftp` under the service column:
> ![d9d287ac640e8a99abbd0ee225c4eb08.png](/resources/85409822838247a0a7d0cf24021396ae.png)

3. What is the FQDN for the website hosted using a self-signed certificate and contains critical server information as the homepage?
   *`dev.probe.thm`*

> [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) stands for Fully Qualified Domain Name (i.e. `beta.example.thm`). Check the Nmap scan and look for `ssl/http` in the service column and we'll find the FQDN as well as some data leaked in the URL:
> ![1efcc44c249e3452b38a37bafcd2d098.png](/resources/14515e3b150948c382c78c08c3c6508e.png)

4. What is the email address associated with the SSL certificate used to sign the website mentioned in Q3?
   *<probe@probe.thm>*

> First let's add the domain found from question 3 into `/etc/hosts` by using the command: `sudo echo '<TARGET_IP> <FQDN_FROM_QUESTION3>' >> /etc/hosts`
> Next we use OpenSSL to get more information about the SSL certificate by running: `openssl s_client -connect <FQDN_FROM_QUESTION3>:443`
> And you should see the same email address multiple times:
> ![94f2e974dacc050770add80a60dac512.png](/resources/bd26fd01e07345b6bc29f0edf0c3d9f2.png)

5. What is the value of the **PHP Extension Build** on the server?
   *API20190902,NTS*

> The web page on `https://dev.probe.thm:1443` has the PHP Info page with all related information. The PHP Extension Build should be towards the bottom of the page:
> ![d3962ad1dcf0fa5dae3ceb093d5c773a.png](/resources/d154a085e6fb4d9998132f4baaf953dc.png)

6. What is the banner for the FTP service?
   \*\*

> We can connect to the FTP service using the command `ftp anonymous@$RHOSTS -p 1338` and the banner is displayed once we establish a connection:
> ![5a9b6e9aea13162b00633426ead6d6ab.png](/resources/52d252e297fc4a21903599a4b69e79c2.png)

7. What software is used for managing the database on the server?
   *phpmyadmin*

> Let's do a directory search using a fuzzing tool like [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster): `feroxbuster -u https://dev.probe.thm:1443 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-1443-dev-ferox.txt -k`
>
> - `-u` ... Is our target address
> - `-w` ... Path to wordlist, I used [this wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt)
> - `-x` ... Includes these extensions
> - `-s` ... Only list URLs that return status code 200, 301, 302 or 403
> - `-o` ... Save output to a text file
> - `-k` ... To ignore self-signed SSL certificates
>   After a few moments we will have the URLs for the backend software:
>   ![1b5045f73e7d12b4b27accaea2b43b45.png](/resources/ed24f634033c4370bfe3e289f1096080.png)

8. What is the Content Management System (CMS) hosted on the server?
   *WordPress*

> Back to our Nmap scan, there are two ports running on HTTP on port 8000 and 9007:
> ![6fedf03c9f0f02e5cc8b971e0e85619e.png](/resources/d659356f54af448b99034db284bfcc98.png)
> Visiting `dev.probe.thm:8000` leads to a blank page, so let's try `dev.probe.thm:9007`:
> ![d84bfd355abcf8b0da835285d574ea2a.png](/resources/9c24b0661a744515b947d36b4aacd160.png)
> Using the Wappalyzer ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/)/[Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wappalyzer-technology-pro/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg)) browser extension we can quickly identify which CMS is powering the blog:
> ![5db59291676ff4e5bb6632db8bf009d8.png](/resources/39ffce393aa042d5a08bf62332ebe745.png)

9. What is the version number of the CMS hosted on the server?
   *6.2.2*

> Same as question 8

10. What is the username for the admin panel of the CMS?
    *`joomla`*

> The default location for the admin panel is `/wp-admin`, but if we try to visit `https://dev.probe.thm:9007/wp-admin/` we get redirected to another domain which we'll need to add to our `/etc/hosts` file to access:
> Before:
> ![50df196485dfaa8b01a3e96d098371d0.png](/resources/3f956dd073cb4b41950b38d474988ea4.png)
> After:
> ![fd23560ffef1ec57b49faf91db946f81.png](/resources/e05290cf451346feb521b98ed0374ebc.png)
> Now we can use the WPScan tool to enumerate for usernames by running the command: `wpscan --url https://myblog.thm:9007 -e u --disable-tls-checks`
>
> - `--url` ... Target address
> - `-e u` ... Enumerate usernames
> - `--disable-tls-checks` ... Since the SSL certificate is self-signed and not approved by the CA, WPScan will not run without this flag
>   After a few moments we will have a valid username:
>   ![f5454f767fa4afb11ec229b151365c69.png](/resources/7eeebbb8406f4019a566ee82ce6e1c53.png)

11. During vulnerability scanning, **OSVDB-3092** detects a file that may be used to identify the blogging site software. What is the name of the file?
    *`license.txt`*

> If you search for "OSVDB-3092", the results will show that it's a warning from the [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) vulnerability scanning tool.
> We can run our own scan using the following command:`nikto -h https://myblog.thm:9007 -Tuning 1`
>
> - `-h` ... Target address
> - `-Tuning 1` ... Search for interesting files

12. What is the name of the software being used on the standard HTTP port?
    *`lighttpd`*

> Check the Nmap scan again for port 80, which is the standard HTTP port:
> ![a3c69566e19462a6935aade262fab412.png](/resources/c12809d77cbb42318c7275da28557cc5.png)

13. What is the flag value associated with the web page hosted on port 8000?
    *THM{CONTACT\_US\_1100}*

> Using feroxbuster again, we'll try to find any files and directories by running the comand: `feroxbuster -u http://dev.probe.thm:8000 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-8000-dev-ferox.txt`
>
> - `-u` ... Is our target address
> - `-w` ... Path to wordlist, I used [this wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt)
> - `-x` ... Includes these extensions
> - `-s` ... Only list URLs that return status code 200, 301, 302 or 403
> - `-o` ... Save output to a text file
>   After a while, we'll find a URL that we haven't seen before:
>   ![2842ab1fd54ce043ef2a44eed3276b08.png](/resources/83d2334ddd32418392feba9e3ccf0dea.png)
>   Visiting `http://dev.probe.thm:8000/contactus` will give us the final flag.
