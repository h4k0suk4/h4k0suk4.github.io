# Scenario

Woah, check out this radical app! Isn't it narly dude? We've been surfing through some webpages and we want to get you on board too! They said this application has some functionality that is only available for internal usage -- but if you catch the right wave, you can probably find the sweet stuff!

Access this challenge by deploying both the vulnerable machine by pressing the green "Start Machine" button located within this task, and the TryHackMe AttackBox by pressing the  "Start AttackBox" button located at the top-right of the page.

Navigate to the following URL using the AttackBox: <HTTP://MACHINE\\\\_IP>

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.184.88 - surfer.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.184.88 surfer.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.184.88
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

Let's start by using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt) to fuzz for directories and files:

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://dreaming.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

The scan might take a while, but we will find most of what we need in the first couple of minutes. After finding these URLs, we can cancel the scan using `CTRL + C`:

### \[-] surfer.thm/backup/chat.txt

```plaintext
Admin: I have finished setting up the new export2pdf tool.
Kate: Thanks, we will require daily system reports in pdf format.
Admin: Yes, I am updated about that.
Kate: Have you finished adding the internal server.
Admin: Yes, it should be serving flag from now.
Kate: Also Don't forget to change the creds, plz stop using your username as password.
Kate: Hello.. ?
```

### \[-] surfer.thm/login.php

If we go to the home page we get redirected to a login portal:

![2a15a102585b8aaabc9be3d3033ec563.png](/resources/9d12e131a20648e6957f9d60fd3a86b1.png)

We can login using the default credentials `admin`:`admin`:

![f766ec5d649de659ae17718a9ead1c70.png](/resources/87a2e039dbbf41a2880aee4346601363.png)

Towards the bottom of the page, we have an "Export to PDF" button:

![f01ef47011e5542b79f5967ba157a043.png](/resources/febd9ab0dc7c4a89bf231018dfeba410.png)

### surfer.thm/export2pdf.php

Clicking the "Export to PDF" button generates a report for the server:

![df25b722ed0d5f3037a3b47ffbfbdece.png](/resources/33e3e6f472054b90a7049c7baf7e10e3.png)

To test this function, let's open the website using a proxy tool like [ZAP](zaproxy.org/) or [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) - I will be using ZAP.

In ZAP, click on the "Quick Start" tab, then "Manual Explore", enter the URL, select your preferred browser from the dropdown list and click the "Launch Browser" button:

![23b5f9347cf2f3aea002c1fc59a32c0e.png](/resources/51c5ff810af34e2ebc5dabfc66eb32a3.png)

Login to the website again using `admin`:`admin` and then switch back to ZAP. Click on the green circle icon to set break on all requests and responses:

![5095a93538b40e1392d0c226be85ee7d.png](/resources/a46c991908514e41816f19a564f6aa23.png)

The icon will turn red after clicking it to indicate ZAP will break requests and responses so we can have the chance to modify our requests before sending it to the server:

![efe68628766868929d5aa0f266216e87.png](/resources/441fc79ba81a4a0ba6363db719fa3aa8.png)

Switch back to the browser that we opened with ZAP, then click on the "Export to PDF" button. The ZAP window should take focus, if not switch to it. From here, we will be under the "Break" tab where we can modify our request of the `url` parameter:

![21e82889df2288415356d956e0fe3c62.png](/resources/5920023d2cc542828cf5cd2752b65f52.png)

Let's test to see if we can read an internal system file like `/etc/passwd` by changing our request from `http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%2Fserver-info.php` to `file:///etc/passwd`:

![70c0317fa5c9d0d71f84bf7cb6214885.png](/resources/579300881d164e51a2e0e113a8fff056.png)

Then click the triangle icon to forward all requests:

![862b3fd02174ed61065d60580a2324c8.png](/resources/64e5d827990b45e7a7d9272c29d0c636.png)

When we switch back to the web browser, we should have a PDF with the contents of `/etc/passwd`:

![8e94584fa60a216858f73a9bb7f7bf00.png](/resources/b88792761695461aad902f8d5f9e2302.png)

### \[-] surfer.thm/internal/admin.php

From our earlier enumeration, we know there is an `/internal` directory where the flag is. We can try some common file names like `admin.php`:

Let's modify the request using ZAP again and change the `url` parameter to `file:///var/www/html/internal/admin.php`:

![8d7d5d357c58c5aa7bc46b0d9c3aa15f.png](/resources/fdf72964f67544e59357610b62b84009.png)

Switching back to the web browser, we should see a PDF of the source code for `admin.php`:

![19bab94fcf6b18664937a20c7522e786.png](/resources/58c14446d5c043b59611d91da4d8681b.png)
