# Memory - Brief

An in-depth analysis of specific endpoints is reserved for those you're certain to have been compromised. It is usually done to understand how specific adversary tools or malwares work on the endpoint level; the lessons learned here are applied to the rest of the incident.

You're presented with two main artefacts: a memory dump and a disk image. Can you follow the artefact trail and find the flag?

***

## Q & A

1. What binary gives the most apparent sign of suspicious activity in the given memory image?

   Use the full path of the artefact.

   *`C:\Tools\svchost.exe`*

Run `./vol.py -f /home/ubuntu/Desktop/RobertMemdump/memdump.mem windows.pslist.PsList > pslist.txt`. The `svchost.exe` binary is the parent process of a `powershell.exe` process (PPID 1036) - which could indicate persistence via auto logon service.

Next run `./vol.py -f /home/ubuntu/Desktop/RobertMemdump/memdump.mem windows.pstree.PsTree > pstree.txt
` and `grep` for `svchost.exe` which will reveal another binary named `svchost.exe` in another directory, `C:\Tools\` and is running a reverse shell command.

2. The answer above shares the same parent process with another binary that references a `.txt` file - what is the full path of this `.txt` file?

   *`C:\Users\Bobby\Documents\tmp\part2.txt`*

Run `cat pstree.txt | grep txt`

# Disk - Brief

The disk image can be found in drive D:\Disk. You can also opt to connect to the machine via RDP using the credentials below.

- Username: `Administrator`
- Password: `Bobby_disk`

## Q & A

1. What binary gives the most apparent sign of suspicious activity in the given disk image?
   Use the full path of the artefact.
   **Hint**: Auto connects to what? Is `connector.ps1` downloaded or created?
   *`C:\Tools\windows-networking-tools-master\windows-networking-tools-master\LatestBuilds\x64\Autoconnector.exe`*

Open the image in FTK Imager then click on the suspcious `svchost.exe` in `C:\Tools\`. In the `Zone.Identifier` file we will find a URL which has the directory `Autoconnector`:

There is also an `Autoconnector` directory on the image in the `C:\Tools\` directory.

2. What is the full registry path where the existence of the binary above is confirmed?
   *`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\bam\State\UserSettings\S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1008`*

Export all registry hives and associated files (Default, SAM, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, etc) from `C:\Windows\System32\Config` then import into Registry Explorer tool and use the Find function to search for `autoconnector.exe`.

3. What is the content of "Part2"?
   *faDB3XzJfcDF2T1R9*

The text file `part2.txt` is in `C:\Users\Bobby\Documents\tmp\`

4. What is the flag?
   *THM{6l4D\_y0u\_kNOw\_h0w\_2\_p1vOT}*

To find part 1 of the flag, enable PowerShell logging with the Local Group Policy Editor tool under Administrative Templaes > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell:

![523d3ed2f7757e815e083f9b738ecd8d.png](/resources/dc8dc01183df4355b6363137f153ba6c.png)

Extract the `C:\Tools\` directory using FTK Imager and run the malware in `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\tools\Tools\windows-networking-tools-master\windows-networking-tools-master\LatestBuilds\x64\Autoconnector.exe`.

Next, open the Event Viewer and navigate to Applications and Services > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational. You can comb through the logs or search for `connector.ps1` to find what commands the malware ran:

Combine this string with the one found in `flag2.txt` and decode the complete base64 string to find the flag.
