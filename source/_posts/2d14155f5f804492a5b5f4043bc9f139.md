## 6. Homebound

### Background

Based on their tweets, it appears our cybercriminal is indeed heading home as they claimed. Their Twitter account seems to have plenty of photos which should allow us to piece together their route back home. If we follow the trail of breadcrumbs they left behind, we should be able to track their movements from one location to the next back all the way to their final destination. Once we can identify their final stops, we can identify which law enforcement organization we should forward our findings to.

### Instructions

In OSINT, there is oftentimes no "smoking gun" that points to a clear and definitive answer. Instead, an OSINT analyst must learn to synthesize multiple pieces of intelligence in order to make a conclusion of what is likely, unlikely, or possible. By leveraging all available data, an analyst can make more informed decisions and perhaps even minimize the size of data gaps. In order to answer the following questions, use the information collected from the attacker's Twitter account, as well as information obtained from previous parts of the investigation to track the attacker back to the place they call home.

## Q & A

1. What airport is closest to the location the attacker shared a photo from prior to getting on their flight?
   *DCA*

> From their Twitter/X [post](https://x.com/SakuraLoverAiko/status/1353471045148110848) we can see the Washington Monument in the distance. The closest airport is [Ronald Reagan Washington Nation Airport/DCA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UCbwmxuUsvcWspcv6).

2. What airport did the attacker have their last layover in?
   *HND*

> In the next [post](https://x.com/SakuraLoverAiko/status/1353717763097899010) they mention they are at their final layover location and provide a picture:

> Searching for "JAL Sakura Lounge", we will find the location of the picture is in Haneda Airport.

3. What lake can be seen in the map shared by the attacker as they were on their final flight home?
   *Lake Inawashiro*

> In this Twitter/X [post](https://x.com/SakuraLoverAiko/status/1353733617487241217) we will find a satellite view of the map:

> Using [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qGP2pqK4QmARUD187) we can get a satellite view of Japan and try to match up the location by using the island on the left as a key location. After that it should be easy to find the lake nearby:

4. What city does the attacker likely consider "home"?
   *Hirosaki*

> From the saved WiFi note, there was a city wifi SSID which has the name of their home city.
