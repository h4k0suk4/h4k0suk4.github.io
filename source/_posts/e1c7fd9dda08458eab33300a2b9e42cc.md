Welcome to the OSINT challenge, part of TryHackMe’s Red Teaming Path. In this task, you will be an ethical hacker aiming to exploit a newly developed web application.

SuperSecure Corp, a fast-paced startup, is currently creating a blogging platform inviting security professionals to assess its security. The challenge involves using OSINT techniques to gather information from publicly accessible sources and exploit potential vulnerabilities in the web application.

Start by deploying the machine; Click on the Start Machine button in the upper-right-hand corner of this task to deploy the virtual machine for this room.

Your goal is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the application using a combination of recon and OSINT skills. As you progress, you’ll look for weak points in the app, find sensitive data, and attempt to gain unauthorized access. You will leverage the skills and knowledge acquired through the Red Team Pathway to devise and execute your attack strategies.

Note: Please allow the machine 3 - 5 minutes to fully boot. Also, no local privilege escalation is necessary to answer the questions.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.126.112 - grep.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```
$ sudo echo '10.10.126.112 grep.thm' >> /etc/hosts
$ export RHOSTS=10.10.126.112
$ rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
$ sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 443 - HTTPS

### \[-] grep.thm/public/html/index.php

Here we have a website under development. It only has links to a login page and a registration page:

![b5bf06f537c6d0dedf32e241312a05d3.png](/resources/c9c2127f0a8b465899846bf9d8779124.png)

### \[-] grep.thm/public/html/register.php

If we try to register a new account we receive an error message stating the API key is invalid or expired:

![f5fdc377f04ee4b5c2f2ffdd8a331faa.png](/resources/6319d7d5b6424828a9c558faddb34fa6.png)

Using [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) we can see the request and response in detail:

![edb16d7401c28f13f97510dc6fc9af49.png](/resources/b7bd7c96551543b0b004ddf161688ddc.png)

### \[-] github.com

Since the website is named "SearchME" let's try to search for this API key on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=searchme+language%3APHP\&type=repositories\&l=PHP).

We know the webpages are coded in PHP, so if we search for `searchme language:PHP` we find a repository by "supersecuredeveloper":

![be9896686ced506ebe5a2c0a643a0498.png](/resources/d61e7b78328540a09befb53ae50d7eb6.png)

In the respository "[supersecuredeveloper/searchmecms](https://github.com/supersecuredeveloper/searchmecms)", we find a directory named "api":

![3eda1e3690a2d6c45f14015465db8de7.png](/resources/8005241e04b94ca6a150a9a77f3de176.png)

Inside the "api" directory we find the source code for the registration page, "register.php" and a file upload page, "upload.php":

![8d8aa31f1a3f79f1d9bd3a9ee17279a3.png](/resources/108d1c4bf5104ec1ba82bd5342c17a37.png)

On line 7 of the source code we can see the `X-THM-API-Key` is set to `TBA`. We can click the history button to see if it used to contain the actual API key:

![8a3b9b707105a34fe310381141a6ae27.png](/resources/98390c8da34b472b9fb2a615ad94c7bc.png)

Commit `db11421` has the description "Fix: remove key" and commit `ccff6f0` was the initial commit, before the edit:

![2f4c29da5c2b6a13db0ac1300231013b.png](/resources/5002e0d3811441d7a7d3333f7d38972d.png)

After clicking on the initial commit, we scroll down to "register.php" to find the API key on line 7:

![2bb5d5c7dae61d2641f40f2b5a37fbbd.png](/resources/51b67a1324b5490fbe8e12b31c4be708.png)

### \[-] grep.thm/public/html/register.php

Back in ZAP, using the Manual Request Editor, we can use this API key to see if it will allow us to register a new account by replacing the old API key in the request header field "`X-Thm-Api-Key`" to the key we found in GitHub:

![63572100ec27bbc97d5c8b2de77bc018.png](/resources/8aad4f7cbc7a410e9bc321343e26f67c.png)

After clicking "Send" to forward our modified request we receive the message "Registration successful" in reponse:

![a490568430895338c7ca60e78a8f3309.png](/resources/c206168d5d254597971f021d22e7e3b7.png)

### \[-] grep.thm/public/html/dashboard.php

Logging in with our new credentials we land on the dashboard page and get the first flag:

![9aa0fe80050d4cbfd595afa1975376b3.png](/resources/80ac4f369c5647e5a8410cc92cc1f440.png)

Now that we are authenticated let's try to visit the file upload page we found in the GitHub repository.

### \[-] grep.thm/public/html/upload.php

From the GitHub repository, we know the page is named "upload.php" so let's modify the current URL we are using from "grep.thm/public/html/dashboard.php" to "grep.thm/public/html/upload.php":

![a3b42c7c3aef9989119832df13bea1fd.png](/resources/0ff83ab1d0c441e6a5132aba56f2b1b1.png)

We can try to upload a PHP [reverse shell](https://www.revshells.com/) here but there is a filter that will only allow JPG, JPEG, PNG, and BMP files:

![623ecf516ebead186e581961b13e116e.png](/resources/912c869939694bc1b23f23974dd7bf24.png)

Reponse:

![b7a29105124b7bec456032335b863ba4.png](/resources/af1f1ce73ab64a0f861027d346cb3e11.png)

### \[-] github.com

If we go back to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/supersecuredeveloper/searchmecms/blob/main/api/upload.php) and check the source code for "upload.php". Starting from line 6 we can see that there is a function that is checking for the [magic bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) of the uploaded file and will only upload files that match the magic bytes for JPG, PNG and BMP:

![c9b22ef07154fd9ffcb8d3c9e5a4ace8.png](/resources/6104e50abd9a4f889c3ae42676143da4.png)

```
function checkMagicBytes($fileTmpPath, $validMagicBytes) {
    $fileMagicBytes = file_get_contents($fileTmpPath, false, null, 0, 4);
    return in_array(bin2hex($fileMagicBytes), $validMagicBytes);
}

$allowedExtensions = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'bmp'];
$validMagicBytes = [
    'jpg' => 'ffd8ffe0', 
    'png' => '89504e47', 
    'bmp' => '424d'
];
```

After the file has been successfully uploaded, it will be stored in the `uploads/` directory as shown on line 4:

```
$uploadPath = 'uploads/';
```

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] www-data

To get a reverse shell we'll generate a PHP script using [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/). Enter the attacker machine's IP and port then scroll down to PHP Ivan Sincek then save the file as "payload.php":

![8445cbef6071aef0913fc055c74d51d4.png](/resources/7728ee894f0a4080b41344a20594752e.png)

Next we edit the "payload.php" file in a text editor and append `AAAA; ` to the beginning of the file:

![ed5bb34786be69187c4e9102b8156720.png](/resources/560be7d97aaa46248e1bb02850ca0df3.png)

To change the magic bytes of this file to match the allowed file types of the file upload page we need to use a hex editor. Since we appended `AAAA` to the beginning of the PHP reverse shell, we know exactly which bytes to change in the hex editor as the character `A` will be `41` in hex.

I used [hexedit](https://github.com/pixel/hexedit) for this task, but any hex editor is fine. Checking the current file type of "payload.php" using `file` shows "C++ source, ASCII text":

```
$ file
payload.php: C++ source, ASCII text
```

![bbe728206b43b6730a398fa23a1c85c7.png](/resources/59a7a5865d964e93810691862480fd89.png)

When we open "payload.php" in `hexedit` we can see the four `A` characters at the beginning as `41 41 41 41`:

![908386c355d5462d97f57169c9b21eaa.png](/resources/1947f83adc4e46d0af3cd79023fd4b66.png)

Looking back at the source code for "upload.php" we can pick any of these magic bytes to bypass the filter:

```
$validMagicBytes = [
    'jpg' => 'ffd8ffe0', 
    'png' => '89504e47', 
    'bmp' => '424d'
];
```

Since we used `AAAA` let's choose the magic bytes for JPG and change `41 41 41 41` to `FF D8 FF E0`:

![a426eaaf214488657713ee625375c667.png](/resources/1eecbdd109d9463586179941ed623922.png)

After pressing `CTRL`+`X` and saving our changes we can check the file type again using `file` and see that it's now recognized as a JPG file:

```
$ file payload.php
payload.php: JPEG image data
```

![f23d59c8b158ae63623f6cf255ae26a0.png](/resources/29033272db6b46b4a823b97103bad9a0.png)

Now when we go to upload this file we will bypass the filter and get the message "File uploaded successfully" in response:

![c3675e8ab2ae083040c4188c06972261.png](/resources/c68f7f6178004292a9f2a1d1750e723f.png)

To get a reverse shell we now start a listener on port 4444 on the attacker machine using [nc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc):

```
$ nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then we access the PHP reverse shell script in `https://grep.thm/api/uploads/payload.php` and check back to the terminal running `nc`:

![b3adc7d34672145e4cb540fdf0eed235.png](/resources/58856082929b4c9cb0350b360fa64f85.png)

Moving up a few directories we land in `/var/www` which has some interesting directories:

```
$ cd /var/www
$ ls -lah
```

![77fc76486b80c9e02a149b39006969cd.png](/resources/46ac4752b5fb4e19bf4565bdba2d0645.png)

First let's look at `/backup/` which has an SQL file named "users":

```
$ cd backup
$ ls -lah
```

![85c9d00d8ddc898fadbd90cd0245b1c3.png](/resources/6253e6b103de4e9dad04dd9bd0379108.png)

Using `cat` we can check the contents and find the e-mail for the user "admin":

```
$ cat users.sql
```

![af20a0a0cfc06d0d8d2d87af28ee00e9.png](/resources/a134bff6b60a4af69a69d360401c22e6.png)

The other directory we found was `/leakchecker/` which could be a subdomain. We can check this by looking in the `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/` directory for the configuration file:

```
$ ls -lah /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
```

![b4204993fcf8ad8fd908f406a0539834.png](/resources/a2df4c3299644bf7a590c2554629f2cb.png)

And if we use `cat` to output the contents of the leakchecker.conf file we can see it is hosted at the URL `leakchecker.grep.thm` on port 51337:

![9c036c6f295ed1a03f7c4391ec3f2df2.png](/resources/288196f1200c4854872e447ffaf6d941.png)

### \[-] leakchecker.grep.thm:51337

To get the last flag we just need to visit this website and enter the admin's e-mail that we found from "users.sql":

![54df7a9b9b309b50094efc1e19842696.png](/resources/da086db14fe24bb1bcb4b370787f0d34.png)
