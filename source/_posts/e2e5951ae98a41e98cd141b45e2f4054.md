## 2. Tip-Off

### Background

The OSINT Dojo recently found themselves the victim of a cyber attack. It seems that there is no major damage, and there does not appear to be any other significant indicators of compromise on any of our systems. However during forensic analysis our admins found an image left behind by the cybercriminals. Perhaps it contains some clues that could allow us to determine who the attackers were?

We've copied the image left by the attacker, you can view it in your browser [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OsintDojo/public/3f178408909bc1aae7ea2f51126984a8813b0901/sakurapwnedletter.svg).

### Instructions

Images can contain a treasure trove of information, both on the surface as well as embedded within the file itself. You might find information such as when a photo was created, what software was used, author and copyright information, as well as other metadata significant to an investigation. In order to answer the following question, you will need to thoroughly analyze the image found by the OSINT Dojo administrators in order to obtain basic information on the attacker.
