# Scenario

Sunny is a SOC analyst at E-corp, which manufactures rare earth metals for government and non-government clients. She receives a classified intelligence report that informs her that an APT group (APT28) might be trying to attack organizations similar to E-corp. To act on this intelligence, she must use the MITRE ATT\&CK Navigator to identify the TTPs used by the APT group, to ensure it has not already intruded into the network, and to stop it if it has.

Please visit [this link](https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/eviction/) to check out the MITRE ATT\&CK Navigator layer for the APT group and answer the questions below.

## Q & A

1. What is a technique used by the APT to both perform recon and gain initial access?
   *Spearphishing Link*

> Taking a look under both Reconnaissance and Initial Access columns, we'll find one technique that is listed on both columns:
> ![8a9ec662d27adea78c29042c1c242ffc.png](/resources/0b0d4d9c841f424aa3c90c6c4ada752a.png)

2. Sunny identified that the APT might have moved forward from the recon phase. Which accounts might the APT compromise while developing resources?
   *Email Accounts*

> Under the Resource Development column, we can see APT28 uses compromised email accounts to send spearphishing emails:
> ![4040de1f4384d3c5631dc76a2c1dfad4.png](/resources/6ed361a9a25d41f8af1bcd499d57b1d3.png)

3. E-corp has found that the APT might have gained initial access using social engineering to make the user execute code for the threat actor. Sunny wants to identify if the APT was also successful in execution. What two techniques of user execution should Sunny look out for? (Answer format: `<technique 1>` and `<technique 2>`)
   *Malicious File and Malicious Link*

> Under the Execution column, scroll down towards the bottom to find the "User Execution" section and the two techniques:
> ![4beb2061e7169ae644b96fcdba23a73e.png](/resources/d6da617c1565491d968fc3cbb42092d7.png)

4. If the above technique was successful, which scripting interpreters should Sunny search for to identify successful execution? (Answer format: `<technique 1>` and `<technique 2>`)
   *PowerShell and Windows Command Shell*

> Still under the Execution column, towards the top of the page, we'll find the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" section and the two interpreters APT28 uses:
> ![cd538926b580527ad6d68e03979ed8b6.png](/resources/c8915dbfb96c4665be45267e87831d17.png)

5. While looking at the scripting interpreters identified in Q4, Sunny found some obfuscated scripts that changed the registry. Assuming these changes are for maintaining persistence, which registry keys should Sunny observe to track these changes?
   *Registry Run Keys*

> To the right of the Execution column, we have the Persistence column and under the "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" section is where we will find the technique for maintaining persistence:
> ![43f640b29d1d3a62ea782b25018f2cf0.png](/resources/a64b2413681c4e03a3ea559cec4ccfd5.png)

6. Sunny identified that the APT executes system binaries to evade defences. Which system binary's execution should Sunny scrutinize for proxy execution?
   *`Rundll32`*

> Scroll to the right and look for the "Defense Evasion" column, then scroll down until you find the "System Binary Proxy Execution" section:
> ![5f0828e070c9eece28bb7eec0b60c98f.png](/resources/7b88aeba3c7245bb808595fc62707552.png)

7. Sunny identified tcpdump on one of the compromised hosts. Assuming this was placed there by the threat actor, which technique might the APT be using here for discovery?
   *Network Sniffing*

> [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) is a data-network packet analyzer. Scroll to the right and look for the "Discovery" column, then scroll down until you find "Network Sniffing"
> ![38491c3266e6c3f3e45fdbb8a0dd04e5.png](/resources/1ee706b92d6048faa5a7af44b8e34816.png)

8. It looks like the APT achieved lateral movement by exploiting remote services. Which remote services should Sunny observe to identify APT activity traces?
   *SMB/Windows Admin Shares*

> SMB and other Shared folders can be used to place malicious files in order to steal NTLM hashes or create reverse shells, etc. We can find this under the "Lateral Movement" column and under the "Remote Services" section:
> ![c02d0ffefe8e6111481c5e939e12e284.png](/resources/37d9f4274290443782609e26a758fb5c.png)

9. It looked like the primary goal of the APT was to steal intellectual property from E-corp's information repositories. Which information repository can be the likely target of the APT?
   *Sharepoint*

> Since E-corp uses Microsoft Office, they probably use other MS services as well. [SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration) is a collaboration platform and information repository. Under the "Collection" column, scroll down to the "Data from Information Repositories" section to find the information repository:
> ![c693f401038e087cec9ea830934b4ec7.png](/resources/7745514b5e434e14ab09cfc1717a5d0c.png)

10. Although the APT had collected the data, it could not connect to the C2 for data exfiltration. To thwart any attempts to do that, what types of proxy might the APT use? (Answer format: `<technique 1>` and `<technique 2>`)
    *External Proxy and Multi-hop Proxy*

> Whenever a connection is being filtered by a firewall, we can use a proxy to bypass the filters in place. APT28 used a Georgian Militay email server as a proxy between NATO victims. We can find this under the "Command and Control" column, then scroll down to the "Proxy" section:
> ![99d5064ce0285a63035d7e8d95f46eba.png](/resources/e1b4e3e6a9394e60afbba6b8ce38a19c.png)
