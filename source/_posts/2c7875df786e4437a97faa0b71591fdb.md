# Scenario

In the weekly internal security meeting it was reported that an employee overheard two co-workers discussing the PrintNightmare exploit and how they can use it to elevate their privileges on their local computers.

**Task**: Inspect the artifacts on the endpoint to detect the exploit they used.

**Note**: Use the **FullEventLogView** tool. Go to `Options > Advanced Options` and set `Show events from all times`.

If you need a refresher on PrintNightmare, see our previous [PrintNightmare room](https://tryhackme.com/room/printnightmarehpzqlp8)!

Deploy the machine attached to this task; it will be visible in the split-screen view once it is ready.

If you don't see a virtual machine load then click the `Show Split View` button.

## Q & A

1. The user downloaded a zip file. What was the zip file saved as?
   *`levelup.zip`*

> Press `CTRL + F` to open the Find tool and search for "`.zip`". There should be only one event where we will find the file name under the `TargetFileName` field:
> ![2c7b7900f4df32ec42907e89f2e06de3.png](/resources/d74ddd3b55a341f494e028afa8733bf2.png)

2. What is the full path to the exploit the user executed?
   *`C:\Users\bmurphy\Downloads\CVE-2021-1675-main\CVE-2021-1675.ps1`*

> Using the find tool again, we can search for the "`.ps1`" extension since a lot of Windows exploits are written in PowerShell. Checking the `Path` field gives us the full path to the exploit:
> ![cbdecc03cc06dc67bbd8e5dcd3c6a8d5.png](/resources/f99db58cd1834ce899e57ca612094b64.png)

3. What was the temp location the malicious DLL was saved to?
   *`C:\Users\bmurphy\AppData\Local\Temp\3\nightmare.dll`*

> Next, we can search for "`nightmare.dll`" since this is the name of the DLL PrintNightmare uses:
> ![fc008c0a9100bcca03efce55f52a2721.png](/resources/66a7c82984db4406a5e932033455c59b.png)

4. What was the full location the DLL loads from?
   *`C:\Windows\system32\spool\DRIVERS\x64\3\nightmare.dll`*

> Clicking on the "Find Next" button from our last search query will bring us to the next file location of the DLL:
> ![5770655421ff6c545b7f5a2630f00bc1.png](/resources/8c8e1abcc096464aac38bd0c50aa02ea.png)

5. What is the primary registry path associated with this attack?
   *`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Drivers\Version-3\THMPrinter\`*

> There are multiple registry keys that are modified by PrintNightmare. We can search for "`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print`" to find one of them:
> ![34afc8c04ac7ddf6c39b5d0d0563241f.png](/resources/ba11f1d34ab2459eae4b00c26efbfe3b.png)

6. What was the PID for the process that would have been blocked from loading a non-Microsoft-signed binary?
   *2600*

> Search for the word "block" to find the error message:
> ![0ea5f5f8d7f58a5a148cab72a0d447d1.png](/resources/13f9c313b2194c4887ea9a601e2d8df6.png)

7. What is the username of the newly created local administrator account?
   *`backup`*

> Search for the word "account was created":
> ![7cd62d313c250ad16a1720f4add5229b.png](/resources/7e8cf74abd6e46538ecc08ccfaad0519.png)

8. What is the password for this user?
   *`ucGGDMyFHkqMRWwHtQ`*

> For the last two question, we will need to use ProcDOT. Load the Logfile.CSV field in the Procmon field and traffic.PCAP file in the Windump field:
> ![de5c22acba64b037d9e828243a0a81a4.png](/resources/b6be877467e54b038afc082e3c215e2b.png)
> Then select "`powershell.exe`" under "Render Configuration":
> ![1662fb1ee50d9c352b225b44c340d4b7.png](/resources/121fa76a9ca14bfc9c4c22b42d0da6b7.png)
> Next, press `CTRL + F` to open the Find tool and search for "history" where we will find the file path to the console history log:
> ![925b553d3c4dd72b9e06bcad8d1082d5.png](/resources/bd88d363f3914f7f8729f2d39266c063.png)
> Pressing `Windows key + R` then pasting in the file path `C:\Users\bmurphy\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt` will open the console log history file where we will find the command used to create the `backup` account:
> ![0f76551580ec6cd92791b5160496d96a.png](/resources/beec7112d8d942a59f04d692524825e6.png)

9. What two commands did the user execute to cover their tracks? (no space after the comma)
   *`rmdir .\CVE-2021-1675-main\,del .\levelup.zip`*

> From the same log as the previous question, we will find the two commands used to delete the directories and files:
> ![e569840abef9283ab70d464d2aab3cb6.png](/resources/4188d391340b442fb2069937116a9453.png)
