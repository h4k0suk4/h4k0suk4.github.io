# Scenario

You were hired as a SOC Analyst for one of the biggest Juice Shops in the world and an attacker has made their way into your network.

Your tasks are:

- Figure out what techniques and tools the attacker used
- What endpoints were vulnerable
- What sensitive data was accessed and stolen from the environment

An IT team has sent you a zip file containing logs from the server. Download the attached file, type in "I am ready!" and get to work! There's no time to lose!

# Reconnaissance

Analyze the provided log files.

Look carefully at:

- What tools the attacker used
- What endpoints the attacker tried to exploit
- What endpoints were vulnerable

## Q & A

1. What tools did the attacker use? (Order by the occurrence in the log)
   *nmap, hydra, sqlmap, curl, feroxbuster*

> Found in the `access.log` file. The name of the tool appears at the end of the log:
> ![fd5701e609ad751d6e02e1155049fed5.png](/resources/c396858935b647bfb92d99bbdf2acf2d.png)

2. What endpoint was vulnerable to a brute-force attack?
   *`/rest/user/login`*

> From the same `access.log` file, we will find the tool Hydra being used to brute force the `/rest/user/login` endpoint with a `POST` request:
> ![c4a46dcc5d46588c890a03d65605aa60.png](/resources/ea454cc6c8eb48ae83a82784e539d342.png)

3. What endpoint was vulnerable to SQL injection?
   *`/rest/products/search`*

> Scrolling towards the end of the `access.log` file, we will find SQL Map being used to test the `/rest/products/search` endpoint:
> ![f0abbfcff0505d4c4b355b2490a13be3.png](/resources/08e2ef06890b44fd99cf96a8dbee2358.png)

4. What parameter was used for the SQL injection?
   *`q`*

> From the same screenshot in question 3, we can see the `q` parameter being tested for injection:
> ![f0abbfcff0505d4c4b355b2490a13be3.png](/resources/08e2ef06890b44fd99cf96a8dbee2358.png)

5. What endpoint did the attacker try to use to retrieve files? (Include the `/`)
   *`/ftp`*

> At the end of the `access.log` file, we will find two `GET` requests for some files on the `/ftp` server:
> ![816510f8ba6fda0d0bf2dc9374f8d5b1.png](/resources/ac04c926499342faac25f16509fa213b.png)

# Stolen Data

Analyze the provided log files.

Look carefully at:

- The attacker's movement on the website
- Response codes
- Abnormal query strings

## Q & A

1. What section of the website did the attacker use to scrape user email addresses?
   *Product Reviews*

> In `access.log` we will find some `GET` requests to `/rest/products/<ID_NUMBER>/reviews`. The number in the endpoint seems to be sequential and what it would look like if someone were to scrape data by exploiting an [IDOR](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor):
> ![ff77cab601f3044ee68fdcea2dfecd36.png](/resources/651af1bdbd444eaf948e74c0778fa8c9.png)

2. Was their brute-force attack successful? If so, what is the timestamp of the successful login? (Yay/Nay, 11/Apr/2021:09:xx:xx +0000)
   *`Yay, 11/Apr/2021:09:16:31 +0000`*

> Checking `access.log` where we found the Hydra tool being used, we will find a `GET` request to the admin panel after a series of login requests which could indicate a successful brute force attack:
> ![b7a416d80507553959dbf44f2a016b5a.png](/resources/f577a6c4a3a546e0b7f961ac86e43080.png)

3. What user information was the attacker able to retrieve from the endpoint vulnerable to SQL injection?
   *email, password*

> From `access.log`, we can check the last request made by SQL Map which shows it was able to enumerate two valid tables:
> ![de68a1d6ce37450083183a37d61fba1e.png](/resources/e8b3433f8f974c818c1c065ec4e9c387.png)

4. What files did they try to download from the vulnerable endpoint? (endpoint from the previous task, question #5)
   *`coupons_2013.md.bak`, `www-data.bak`*

> At the end of the `access.log` file, we will find two `GET` requests for some files on the `/ftp` server:
> ![816510f8ba6fda0d0bf2dc9374f8d5b1.png](/resources/ac04c926499342faac25f16509fa213b.png)

5. What service and account name were used to retrieve files from the previous question? (service, username)
   *`ftp`, `anonymous`*

> In the `vsftpd.log` file we will find the username and service used to download the files:
> ![c1c65adf7a3c519a2c7fe27eb7306807.png](/resources/25742863d8b74475a77fa9848ae8abfb.png)

6. What service and username were used to gain shell access to the server? (service, username)
   *`ssh`, `www-data`*

> Checking the `auth.log` file, we will find the service and username that the attacker used to access the server:
> ![6e672496614325a40994d27b58ecb092.png](/resources/257637e6ab4c4e209ab56b9e83245011.png)
