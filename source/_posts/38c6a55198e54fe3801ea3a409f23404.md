## 1. Introduction

### Background

This room is designed to test a wide variety of different OSINT techniques. With a bit of research, most beginner OSINT practitioners should be able to complete these challenges. This room will take you through a sample OSINT investigation in which you will be asked to identify a number of identifiers and other pieces of information in order to help catch a cybercriminal. Each section will include some pretext to help guide you in the right direction, as well as one or more questions that need to be answered in order to continue on with the investigation. Although all of the flags are staged, this room was created using working knowledge from having led and assisted in OSINT investigations both in the public and private sector.

**Note**: All answers can be obtained via passive OSINT techniques, DO NOT attempt any active techniques such as reaching out to account owners, password resets, etc to solve these challenges.

If you have any other questions, comments, or suggestions, please reach out to us at @OSINTDojo on Twitter.
