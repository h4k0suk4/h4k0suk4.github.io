# Scenario

Hello there,

I am the CEO and one of the co-founders of futurevera.thm. In Futurevera, we believe that the future is in space. We do a lot of space research and write blogs about it. We used to help students with space questions, but we are rebuilding our support.

Recently blackhat hackers approached us saying they could takeover and are asking us for a big ransom. Please help us to find what they can takeover.

Our website is located at <https://futurevera.thm>

**Hint**: Don't forget to add the `10.10.110.166` in /etc/hosts for futurevera.thm ; )

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.110.166 - futurevera.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.110.166 futurevera.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.110.166
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 443 - HTTPS

There's nothing much here and fuzzing for files or directories didn't not yield any interesting resuslts. Let's move on to port 80.

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

We can try to fuzz for subdomains using a fuzzing tool like [wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) with [this wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt). The `-c` option will colorized the output, `-w` is the file path to our wordlist, `-u` is our target URL and `-H` is where we specify our header, the word `FUZZ` will be the subdomains that are being fuzzed with our wordlist and `--hc` will filter out responses that return [status code 302](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302) which are not useful to us:

```sh
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -u "http://futurevera.thm" -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" --hc 302
```

These domains returned a [status code of 200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_200) which means they are accessible. We can add these subdomains we just found to our `/etc/hosts` so we can access them:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo " portal.futurevera.thm payroll.futurevera.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

## \[+] Port 443 - HTTPS

Let's do the same subdomain fuzzing for port 443/HTTPS. This time we will need to filter out responses that have 429 words with the `--fw` option:

```sh
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -u "https://futurevera.thm" -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" --hw 329
```

These domains returned a [status code of 421](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) which our request was misdirected. We can add these subdomains we just found to our `/etc/hosts` so we can access them:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo " support.futurevera.thm blog.futurevera.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

### \[-] support.futurevera.thm

Here, we'll find a customer support website under development:

We can inspect the SSL certificate if we click on the lock icon then the "Connection not secure" button:

![91ff33505119e4824e5c3d9c201333cb.png](/resources/77cb81ff0d3e42a48de0d98316ead530.png)

Then, click on the "More information" button:

![c9ca6eb44a15320839eded5c9754583c.png](/resources/c8af43f4ac194992b4354f01ceb36733.png)

Next, in the "Page Info" window, click on the "View Certificate" button:

![3bb3ed1bc2d582318beeb9bc97c1e21e.png](/resources/0281bdb31f9941d49cb5b31c5e8bd5d0.png)

Scrolling down to "Subject Alt Names" section of the certificate will reveal another subdomain that we weren't able to find earlier:

Let's add this to our `/etc/hosts` file and check it out:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo " secrethelpdesk934752.support.futurevera.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

### \[-] secrethelpdesk934752.support.futurevera.thm

If we try to access this URL in the browser it will just load the main website. Instead, we should use the curl tool with verbosity enabled where we will see the flag in the header:

```sh
curl -vvv http://secrethelpdesk934752.support.futurevera.thm
```
