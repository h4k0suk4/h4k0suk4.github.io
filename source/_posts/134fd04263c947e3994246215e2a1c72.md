This is a relatively easy machine that tries to teach you a lesson, but perhaps you've already learned the lesson? Let's find out.

Treat this box as if it were a real target and not a CTF.

Get past the login screen and you will find the flag. There are no rabbit holes, no hidden files, just a login page and a flag. Good luck!

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.116.139 - lesson.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```
$ sudo echo '10.10.116.139 lesson.thm' >> /etc/hosts
$ export RHOSTS=10.10.116.139
$ rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
$ sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80

### \[-] lesson.thm

Here we have a basic login page:

If we try [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) like `OR 1=1` in the username field we get this message:

![3b2bb3ebd9346674bd19ba23cc5982ca.png](/resources/345c6a09b539466c817fad212b811da8.png)

Trying default credentials of username `admin` and password `admin` returns the error "Invalid username and password":

![d3be8ae2ed57d76aba04673274b620df.png](/resources/4c55d205f8684a7294c8b455ea424b9e.png)

Since both the username and password is wrong, let's try bruteforcing the username parameter to see if we get a different error. For this task I will use [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/).

Under the "Quick Start" tab we select "Manual Explore", enter the URL `http://lesson.thm` and click launch browser:

![e8c789696b3058969275a792e1273507.png](/resources/bedefdbb3081459eaeba31da33d635cb.png)

On the login page, we enter the credentials `admin:admin` again so we can capture the POST request in ZAP's history:

![d84e10916a69cd41c37b0e8ca1894970.png](/resources/83095ce03a9e40108d39021cdc9482bd.png)

Highlight `admin` in the `username` parameter, then right-click and select "Fuzz..." to send the request to ZAP's fuzzer:

![8ecef441a8c664479f30b78e760e72ba.png](/resources/8be9ca4e9cdc4739a13d40747467482d.png)

In the fuzzer window, the username `admin` is already highlighted for us and this is what we are going to fuzz. We can load a username list by clicking "Payloads...":

![3b6a6f7b8f454aab523a7c339f1fe34e.png](/resources/ed0f87359a2246e3b1f748ef20c26bc0.png)

In the next window, click the "Add..." button:

![aae8da68e23e4f4285ee7adf99901a34.png](/resources/36805297753a43ae9138dacde457487d.png)

In the next window, click the drop down menu under "Type" and select "File":

![24adc42a78cdfd046c7507a987766c2b.png](/resources/ea8b519fe4e4414f84c46a100b415cde.png)

Click "Select..." under "File" and browse to your username list text file, I used `xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt` from [Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists):

![bfbd8437f7e4dfec37c260a4c32b637d.png](/resources/d94d9c62254c485196b3a4a1cd7d36c7.png)

After selecting the username list you want to fuzz with, click "Add" > "OK" > "Start Fuzzer" to begin fuzzing.

Let the fuzzer run for a while and when we come back to it, there will be two different sizes of "Size Resp. Body". We can click on that column to sort it to make it easier to find:

![3c52adf1391e03cbb1fbe5f0c1078ee0.png](/resources/2605c91350da4165a864d47587344063.png)

The responses with the Size Resp. Body of 1,253 bytes are the responses with the error "Invalid username and password", but the responses that are 1,240 bytes return the error message "Invalid password" when we check the response tab and scroll down:

![2a09a5a5b9a1405f21bcf9b0c6fc7f54.png](/resources/8b5c264f60934899870e1f816cbaeba9.png)

From here, we can make a new username list of only the usernames that have a Size Resp. Body of 1,240 bytes.

After making a new text file with the usernames we can click the stop icon/square icon in ZAP to stop fuzzing:

![5827b1dcca41918e253b633b27b4b42d.png](/resources/85a3059d0d7d43ed8c8a983d6a2d8f17.png)

Now that we have a list of valid usernames, we can try a different type of SQL injection. Instead of `OR` which we learned will destroy the database, we will use `AND`. Since we are using a valid username, that part of the query will be true so we need to make the rest of the query also true by using `AND '1'='1'`.

We can pick any valid username like `naomi` end that query using a single quote `'` then use `AND` to combine `'1'='1'` which will equal to true and comment out the rest of the query using `-- -`.

Login with the username `naomi' AND '1'='1'-- -`:

And we get the flag:

![2b9df3c637cf9e81cc4ff41ff3c6f58d.png](/resources/192a36c887114a328569ba86686d4c8e.png)
