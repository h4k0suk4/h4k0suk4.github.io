# Scenario

We got our hands on a confidential case file from some self-declared "black hat hackers"... it looks like they have a secret invite code available within a QR code, but it's covered by some image in this PDF! If we want to thwart whatever it is they are planning, we need your help to uncover what that QR code says!

Access this challenge by deploying the machine attached to this task by pressing the green "Start Machine" button. This machine shows in Split View in your browser, if it doesn't automatically display you may need to click "Show Split View" in the top right.

The file you need is located in `/home/ubuntu/confidential` on the VM.

# Analysis

After opening the PDF in `/home/ubuntu/confidential` we will find the obfuscated QR code that we need to deobfuscate so we can scan the QR code:

Next, right-click on an area - away from the red triangle, then click the "Save as Image" option and save the image. Then when we open the image, we will have just the letter and the QR code. The red triangle is on a separate layer and was not included in the image we saved:

Then we can use a QR code scanner app on a phone to reveal the flag.
