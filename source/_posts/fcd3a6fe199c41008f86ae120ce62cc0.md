# Scenario

Agent T uncovered this website, which looks innocent enough, but something seems off about how the server responds...

After deploying the vulnerable machine attached to this task, please wait a couple of minutes for it to respond.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.130.118 - agentt.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.130.118 agentt.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.130.118
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

# Initial Access

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

From our Nmap scan report, we will find that port 80 is running an outdated and highly vulnerable version of PHP:

Searching for "php 8.1.0-dev exploit" will bring us to this [Exploit-DB PoC by flast101](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933).

After downloading the exploit, we just have to supply the URL when running the script where we will get a remote shell as root:

```
python3 49933.py
http://agentt.thm
```

Even though we have a root shell, the exploit is restricted to the current working directory. To find the root flag, we can search for files with "`.txt`" in the filename. We will find the flag in `/flag.txt`:

```sh
find / -iname "*.txt" 2>/dev/null
cat /flag.txt
```
