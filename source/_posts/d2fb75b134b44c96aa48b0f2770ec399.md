# Scenario

[Compiled-1688545393558.Compiled](/resources/af22d9aa33184956a0d5760624a77f82.Compiled)

Download the task file and get started. The binary can also be found in the AttackBox inside the `/root/Rooms/Compiled/` directory.

**Note**: The binary will not execute if using the AttackBox. However, you can still solve the challenge.

## Q & A

Using a debugging tool like [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/), we can figure out what the binary is doing and find out what the password is.

In the CodeBrowser, on the right window pane, we have the decompiled main function:

![713a7a70c339c7ffa18921d728fdffd2.png](/resources/691cb3c9ed9748d09397414e71ab8b5c.png)

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  char local_28 [32];
  
  fwrite("Password: ",1,10,stdout);
  __isoc99_scanf("DoYouEven%sCTF",local_28);
  iVar1 = strcmp(local_28,"__dso_handle");
  if ((-1 < iVar1) && (iVar1 = strcmp(local_28,"__dso_handle"), iVar1 < 1)) {
    printf("Try again!");
    return 0;
  }
  iVar1 = strcmp(local_28,"_init");
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    printf("Correct!");
  }
  else {
    printf("Try again!");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

First the program is asking the user for input using the [fwrite](https://linux.die.net/man/3/fwrite) function:

```c
fwrite("Password: ",1,10,stdout);
```

Next it uses the [scanf](https://linux.die.net/man/3/scanf) function to search for the string `DoYouEven%sCTF`. The `%s` portion is a place holder and will be replaced by the value stored in `local_28` which is the user input from the last step:

```c
__isoc99_scanf("DoYouEven%sCTF",local_28);
```

From there it will compare the user input string in the variable `local_28` with the string "`__dso_handle`" using [strcomp](https://linux.die.net/man/3/strcmp). Which will print the response "Try again!" using [printf](https://linux.die.net/man/3/printf):

```c
strcmp(local_28,"__dso_handle"), iVar1 < 1)) {
    printf("Try again!");
```

But if the string is "`_init`" it will print the response "Correct!".

```c
  iVar1 = strcmp(local_28,"_init");
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    printf("Correct!");
```

So if we put everything together, we should have the base string "`DoYouEven%s`" and the correct string, "`_init`" to replace the placeholder "`%s`":

1. What is the password?
   *`DoYouEven_init`*
