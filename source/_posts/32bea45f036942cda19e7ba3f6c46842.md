# Scenario

## Fred Flintstone & Barney Rubble!

Barney is setting up the ABC webserver, and trying to use TLS certs to secure connections, but he's having trouble. Here's what we know\...

- He was able to establish `nginx` on port `80`,  redirecting to a custom TLS webserver on port `4040`
- There is a TCP socket listening with a simple service to help retrieve TLS credential files (client key & certificate)
- There is another TCP (TLS) helper service listening for authorized connections using files obtained from the above service
- Can you find all the Easter eggs?

Please allow an extra few minutes for the VM to fully startup.

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.151.47 - b3dr0ck.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.151.47 b3dr0ck.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.151.47
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 4040 - HTTPS

### \[-] b3dr0ck.thm:4040

Visiting the URL on default port 80 sends us to the HTTPS web page on port 4040:

Since the clue mentions a number over 9000, let's try the service on port 9009.

## Port 9009 - TCP

We can use [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) to interact with this service. Upon connecting, we will see a welcome banner and a pseudo terminal where we can enter some basic commands, like `help`:

```sh
nc $RHOST 9009
help
```

![b8ee8fd35ebf77c0b48a1f6018791d94.png](/resources/749f7b870c47477c8d3f138ab636301e.png)

If we just hit the `Enter` key, we will find two more commands:

![e40370f25db2089a3d4c2286dd092116.png](/resources/6f293c6d19d34c59b775b2f88c3492f8.png)

Inputting `client certificate` will return a certificate which we can copy and save to a text file named `b3dr0ck.cert`:

![0159482614ec938f1aee8254cddde6dd.png](/resources/6444b6dbddf041a5866a1175bfe45878.png)

And if we input `private key` we will get a private key in reponse which we will save in a text file as `b3dr0ck.key`:

![525c99639f176c437b7847f19deac4ad.png](/resources/7178a3ce58ee4f3b990b6a687ff2be01.png)

## \[-] Port 54321

Next, we will close our `nc` connection and use the [socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat) command we found from the `help` command:

```sh
socat stdio ssl:$RHOSTS:54321,cert=b3dr0ck.cert,key=b3dr0ck.key,verify=0
```

Upon connecting, we will find another psuedo terminal:

![798b5fd01899090433910039fc499909.png](/resources/bcb0982c1ada4385864febd152a4c5d6.png)

If we run the `help` command we will find a username and a password hint encoded in MD5:

![a09a57eace33ca14287a13dbc4f9f5ff.png](/resources/5768608fcef046239cb766026bc95273.png)

If we try to crack this MD5 hash or use a service to look up the plaintext, we won't be able to find anything.

# Initial Foothold

## \[+] Port 22 - SSH

### \[-] barney\@b3dr0ck

Instead, let's try to use the MD5 hash as the password:

```sh
ssh barney@$RHOSTS
```

![4931304eff4261104adf13d5579d1804.png](/resources/85afce7590c94eada70ba1e18ae41245.png)

Here, we will also find the first flag:

```sh
ls -lah
cat barney.txt
```

![3c8e59221e809547aa4d8a3d5c863936.png](/resources/9cd8dcd6ceb844a68e76f64bf525f22e.png)

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] fred\@b3dr0ck

If we check the [sudo](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo) permissions for our current user, `barney`, we will find that we can run `/usr/bin/certutil` with `sudo` permissions:

```sh
sudo -l
```

![9a8c8edf01fab16a6580e5bc08ad8842.png](/resources/db84d260de63436685890555bae04151.png)

Let's run this binary and see if there is a help menu:

```sh
/usr/bin/certutil --help
```

![295ebffc4b6b4550847a937e9ace9815.png](/resources/96e1d846e82f4e6d8ec9263503ce0b7f.png)

Running `certutil ls` lists all the certificates currently in use:

![99dbbc507ddac025ebf1fb89026ea440.png](/resources/ff3e9fd1435841f8ac86873ecf2c2711.png)

We can generate a new keypair for the user `fred`, but we will need the full name to do so. If you are familiar with the cartoon, then you should know it - if not, we can try checking the `/etc/passwd` file to see if there is any additional information:

```sh
cat /etc/passwd
```

![7021aee8333f8fd9b88713df6772a112.png](/resources/2a7beb9dcea94bb9abaa5ff64266b55a.png)

Next, run the `certutil` command:

```sh
sudo certutil fred 'Fred Flintstone'
```

And we should have a certificate and key generated. Let's save those files like we did earlier as, `fred.key` and `fred.cert`:

![560bfa0042c0cd451e016ca1eafefbe0.png](/resources/123bf5ea823340d48f2fe6b5d7abb6df.png)

## \[+] Port 54321 - TCP

We can use the `socat` command from earlier and change the parameters for the user `fred`:

```sh
socat stdio ssl:$RHOSTS:54321,cert=fred.cert,key=fred.key,verify=0
```

![c2c620fd79ae8162266b65a600c4af12.png](/resources/6d52b598649e454b9fdce972e3901826.png)

If we try the `help` command, we'll find the credentials for SSH login:

```sh
help
```

![a9a085463c79e39320b6b97361444390.png](/resources/c1c933bdff6b433e9464e42f65cb5077.png)

## \[+] Port 22 - SSH

Let's connect via SSH and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
ssh fred@$RHOSTS
```

![404aed7143f57004b139e9830392e53f.png](/resources/b692b9a5b67a441a98d37cdacded4bf6.png)

Here, we'll also find the next flag:

```sh
ls -lah
cat fred.txt
```

![29d32c20b7eb561a9172303a52c04afa.png](/resources/d96ad0510cb2435da1451fe08aa2f198.png)

### \[-] root\@b3dr0ck

Checking our `sudo` privileges reveals something interesting:

```sh
sudo -l
```

![b927f973dfbdbf1b169d4fe8fcf95e3c.png](/resources/c43db9aaa6fc4d5491329f9a1db67155.png)

When we run the `sudo /usr/bin/base64 /root/pass.txt` command we can use the pipe character (`|`) to send the output back to `base64` but with the `-d` flag to decode what we just encoded:

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/base64 /root/pass.txt | base64 -d
```

The output of this file is also encoded; this time in base32:

![8949697d45feaf8ff96257f901272a79.png](/resources/ca7883d026464742ac53efef918dc9b5.png)

We can pipe the output once more to `base32` with the `-d` flag to decode the output:

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/base64 /root/pass.txt | base64 -d | base32 -d
```

![0d2199cc4db960da21cdd964c2690f22.png](/resources/915f9770efef4d0c813cb8a19ba98622.png)

The output is encoded again in base64, so we'll pipe it once more to `base64 -d`:

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/base64 /root/pass.txt | base64 -d | base32 -d | base64 -d
```

Now, we have an MD5 hash. We can copy and paste this hash into a tool like [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/):

![9a899a2008f6d88664b441ee1ea900ba.png](/resources/151e6b4eba3347e2b391d8d9663868dc.png)

![24a4b6eab6a105a293b0626548f6cb26.png](/resources/3f9aa99f99224144adffb239864b7c85.png)

After cracking the MD5 hash, we can use the plaintext as the password to switch over to the `root` user:

```sh
su root
```

![a63fc50ac42a7fb9f165a969a6cda45b.png](/resources/7d505c7bacc0443b990303416cadd47f.png)

The last flag will be in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
cat /root/root.txt
```

![8b19f4646f050e414cf50ce0f253247a.png](/resources/d41317b68771472b8857a78e13308e29.png)
