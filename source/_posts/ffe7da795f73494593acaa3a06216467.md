# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.138.70 - coldd.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.138.70 coldd.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.138.70
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## Port 80 - HTTP - WordPress

### \[-] coldd.thm

On the main page, we will find a note from the room author and the "Powered by WordPress" footer:

Using the [WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) tool, we can start enumerating usernames with the following command:

```sh
wpscan --url http://coldd.thm -e
```

![1eb879173d9b178ff9f7c403fae80823.png](/resources/e8fb41804c664eeea7f78090d0e6e00e.png)

Save these usernames to a text file named `users.txt` and then run the WPScan tool again to brute force the usernames with [this password list](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt):

![8dd08c92d2ba6c8c52fb029e0c463755.png](/resources/8ae746b409f54b8c8a6626baba2c8a26.png)

After some time, we will find the password for the username `c0ldd` for the WordPress control panel.

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] coldd.thm/wp-admin/

We can use the credentials we just found to log into the control panel.

### \[-] www-data\@ColddBox

To get a reverse shell, we can overwrite an existing PHP page with [Ivan Sineck's PHP reverse shell](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell) with the control panel and access the page to execute the reverse shell. We can also use [RevShells by 0day](https://www.revshells.com/) shell generator to get the same PHP reverse shell.

Next, we'll go to the WordPress control panel to edit the current theme's 404 page with our reverse shell code. Navigate to `Appearance â†’ Editor`:

![b2d2e50c23df9ebf0a87dfd830dab38f.png](/resources/04a1083dbad040b7b5af2556b20f56b8.png)

Copy all of the PHP reverse shell code and overwrite the code in the `404.php` page then click the "Update" button at the bottom:

![5c15496925557e55e8c6be09c8e590db.png](/resources/496f47eba7ec4c2e88013a8bcbaf9218.png)

In a new terminal, start a Netcat listener:

```sh
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Then we can access the 404 page by changing the parameter of an URL to something that doesn't exist, for example I used the URL for monthly posts (`http://coldd.thm/?m=202010`) then changed the value from `202010` to `999999`.

The web page will hang and after a few seconds when we check back to our Netcat listener, we should have a connection back from the victim machine:

Let's stablize our new shell:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:

   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```

2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell

3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:

   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```

4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:

   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] c0ldd\@ColddBox

Inside every WordPress installation is a `wp-config.php` file which has credentials in plaintext. The configuration file on this machine is located in the `/var/www/html/` folder. Then use `grep` to find the string `username` and print the 5 lines after it with the `-A 5` flag:

```sh
grep -A 5 'username' wp-config.php
```

Using these credentials we can use the `su` command to switch to the `c0ldd` account and enter the password when prompted:

![a5afec32fa4281abb3e57e3cdfa9c1e2.png](/resources/7f990a08127e4c7e9a94044ce1dd6380.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/c0ldd/user.txt`:

![71d15c0e1dca2b7790af3910813c70e6.png](/resources/147e2708093a42f1bb6a4191cd9536f8.png)

### \[-] root\@ColddBox

Let's check our `sudo` permissions for the user `c0ldd` by running `sudo -l` and provide the password when prompted:

![094e12a864e5eb31b9caf0698cb514f1.png](/resources/2214dc6bca1940b7a78f92ab7798417b.png)

At this point we can choose either one of these binaries and search for it on [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to find a privilege escalation method.

I'll choose `vim` since it's the quickest and only requires one command where we use the `vim` binary to execute a bash shell. Since `vim` was ran with `sudo` permissions, the bash shell we spawned inside `vim` is also running with `sudo` permissions, effectively making us root:

```sh
sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
```

If the terminal crashes or freezes, start a new terminal and connect again with the reverse shell and only do step 1 of the shell stabilization.

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

![0429a52ba3d35b953ab32dfe1c01c9a9.png](/resources/dac2a163e8a942808e373ae3f58612f1.png)
