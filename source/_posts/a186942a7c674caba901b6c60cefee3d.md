# Scenario

You've learned some great `nmap` skills! Now can you combine that with other skills with `netcat` and protocols, to log in to this machine and find the flag? This VM `MACHINE_IP` is listening on a high port, and if you connect to it it may give you some information you can use to connect to a lower port commonly used for remote access!

**Access this challenge** by deploying both the vulnerable machine by pressing the green "Start Machine" button located within this task, and the TryHackMe AttackBox by pressing the  "Start AttackBox" button located at the top-right of the page.

Use the AttackBox to scan the target: `MACHINE_IP`

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.113.254

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a 10.10.113.254 --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.10.113.254 -oN nmap.txt
```

After the scan has finished, we will find a non-standard port open on 31337 where we will find some credentials:

We can use these credentials to login remotely via SSH:

```sh
ssh <USERNAME>@<TARGET_IP>
```

To get the flag, we have to move up a directory, where we will find another user named "`user`":

Inside the home directory for `user` is where we will find the `flag.txt` file:

```sh
cd user
cat flag.txt
```
