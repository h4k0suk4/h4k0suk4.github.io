# The Exfiltration Hunt

## Room Prerequisites

Before solving this room, it is recommended to go through the following rooms:

- [Autopsy](https://tryhackme.com/room/btautopsye0)
- [Expediting Registry Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/room/expregistryforensics)
- [File Carving](https://tryhackme.com/room/filecarving)
- [NTFS Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/room/ntfsanalysis)
- [MBR and GPT Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/jr/mbrandgptanalysis)
- [Windows Forensics 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsforensics1)
- [Windows Forensics 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsforensics2)

## Scenario

Tech THM discovered their critical data had been leaked to the competitors. After an internal investigation, the company suspects Liam, a recently terminated employee who was working as a system engineer with Tech THM. This suspicion was raised as Liam had access to the leaked data in his company-provided workstation. He often worked late hours without clear justification for his extended presence. He was also caught roaming around the critical server room and taking pictures of the entry gate. Following these suspicions, Liam’s workstation (provided by the company) was investigated. The initial investigation suggests that an external entity was also helping Liam.

Let's use the knowledge we gained from the previous modules of this path to search for traces of Liam's activities.

### Starting the Machine

Let’s start the virtual machine by pressing the `Start Machine` button below. The machine will start in split view.

In case the VM is not visible, use the blue `Show Split View` button at the top of the page. You can also connect with the machine via your own VPN-connected machine using the RDP credentials below:

**Username**: `Administrator`
**Password**: `disk_analysis@001`
**IP**: `10.10.106.40`

Some important points to note before starting the analysis:

- You can access the recent case located in the `C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\New Folder\Liam's Disk\` folder using the Autopsy tool. This will contain the already ingested disk image, which is ready for investigation.

- The tools that can help you during the investigation are placed on the desktop inside the `Forensic Tools` folder.
